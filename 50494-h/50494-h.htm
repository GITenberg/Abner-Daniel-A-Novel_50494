    <p>
      HE young man stood in the field road giving directions to a robust negro
      who was ploughing the corn, which, in parallel rows, stretched on to the
      main road a quarter of a mile distant. The negro placed the point of his
      ploughshare a few inches from the first stalk of corn, wound the line
      around his wrist, and clucked to his horse. With a jangling jerk of the
      trace-chains the animal lunged ahead: the polished ploughshare cut into
      the mellow soil and sped onward, curling the gray earth like shavings, and
      uprooting and burying the tenacious crab-grass and succulent purslane.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful day. The sun was shining brightly, but the atmosphere
      had dropped a dim veil over the near-by mountain. Even the two-storied
      farm-house, with its veranda and white columns, to which the field road
      led up a gradual slope, showed only its outlines. However, Alan Bishop, as
      he steadied his gaze upon the house, saw the figure of an elderly woman
      come out of the gate and with a quick step hurry down to him. It was his
      mother; she was tall and angular, and had high cheek-bones and small blue
      eyes. She had rather thin gray hair, which was wound into a knot behind
      her head, and over it she wore only a small red breakfast shawl which she
      held in place by one of her long hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alan," she said, panting from her brisk walk, "I want you to come to the
      house right off. Mr. Trabue has come to see yore pa again an' I can't do a
      thing with 'im."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what does he want with him?" asked the young man. His glance was on
      the ploughman and his horse. They had turned the far end of the corn-row
      and were coming back, only the nodding head of the animal being visible
      beyond a little rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's come to draw up the papers fer another land trade yore pa's makin'.
      He's the lawyer fer the Tompkins estate. Yore pa tried to buy the land a
      yeer ago, but it wasn't in shape to dispose of. Oh, Alan, don't you see
      he's goin' to ruin us with his fool notions? Folks all about are
      a-laughin' at him fer buyin' so much useless mountain-land. I'm powerful
      afeered his mind is wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, mother, what could I do?" Alan Bishop asked impatiently. "You know
      he won't listen to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon you can' t stop 'im," sighed the woman, "but I wish you'd come
      on to the house. I knowed he was up to some 'n'. Ever'day fer the last
      week he's been ridin' up the valley an' rollin' and tumblin' at night an'
      chawin' ten times as much tobacco as he ort. Oh, he's goin' to ruin us!
      Brother Abner says he is buyin' beca'se he thinks it's goin' to advance in
      value, but sech property hain't advanced a speck sence I kin remember, an'
      is bein' sold ever' yeer fer tax money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it's very foolish of him," said the young man as the two turned
      towards the house. "Father keeps talking about the fine timber on such
      property, but it is entirely too far from a railroad ever to be worth
      anything. I asked Rayburn Miller about it and he told me to do all I could
      to stop father from investing, and you know he's as sharp a speculator as
      ever lived; but it's his money."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a paling fence around the house, and the enclosure was alive
      with chickens, turkeys, geese, ducks, and peafowls. In the sunshine on the
      veranda two pointers lay sleeping, but at the sound of the opening gate
      they rose, stretched themselves lazily, and gaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are in the parlor," said Mrs. Bishop, as she whisked off her
      breakfast shawl. "Go right in, I 'll come in a minute. I want to see how
      Linda is makin' out with the churnin'. La! I feel like it's a waste o'
      time to do a lick o' work with him in thar actin' like a child. Ef we both
      go in together it 'll look like we've concocked somethin', but we must
      stop 'im ef we kin."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan went into the parlor on the left of the wide, uncarpeted hall. The
      room had white plastered walls, but the ceiling was of boards planed by
      hand and painted sky blue. In one corner stood a very old piano with
      pointed, octagonal legs and a stool with hair-cloth covering. The
      fireplace was wide and high, and had a screen made of a decorated
      window-shade tightly pasted on a wooden frame. Old man Bishop sat near a
      window, and through his steel-framed nose-glasses was carefully reading a
      long document written on legal-cap paper. He paid no attention to the
      entrance of his son, but the lawyer, a short, fat man of sixty-five with
      thick black hair that fell below his coat-collar, rose and extended his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's Alan?" he asked, pleasantly. "I saw you down in the field as I come
      along, but I couldn't catch your eye. You see I'm out after some o' your
      dad's cash. He's buying hisse'f rich. My Lord! if it ever <i>does</i> turn
      his way he 'll scoop in enough money to set you and your sister up for
      life. Folks tell me he owns mighty near every stick of timber-land in the
      Cohutta Valley, and what he has he got at the bottom figure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it ever turns his way," said Alan; "but do you see any prospect of
      it's ever doing so, Mr. Trabue?" The lawyer shrugged his shoulders. "I
      never bet on another man's trick, my boy, and I never throw cold water on
      the plans of a speculator. I used to when I was about your age, but I saw
      so many of 'em get rich by paying no attention to me that I quit right
      off. A man ought to be allowed to use his own judgment." Old Bishop was
      evidently not hearing a word of this conversation, being wholly absorbed
      in studying the details of the deed before him. "I reckon it's all right,"
      he finally said. "You say the Tompkins children are all of age?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Effie was the youngest," answered Trabue, "and she stepped over the
      line last Tuesday. There's her signature in black and white. The deed's
      all right. I don't draw up any other sort."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan went to his father and leaned over him. "Father," he said, softly,
      and yet with firmness, "I wish you'd not act hastily in this deal. You
      ought to consider mother's wishes, and she is nearly distracted over it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop was angry. His massive, clean-shaven face was red. "I'd like to
      know what I'd consult her fer," he said. "In a matter o' this kind a
      woman's about as responsible as a suckin' baby."
    </p>
    <p>
      Trabue laughed heartily. "Well, I reckon it's a good thing your wife
      didn't hear that or she'd show you whether she was responsible or not. I
      couldn't have got the first word of that off my tongue before my wife
      would 'a' knocked me clean through that wall."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred Bishop seemed not to care for levity during business hours, for he
      greeted this remark only with a frown. He scanned the paper again and
      said: "Well, ef thar's any flaw in this I reckon you 'll make it right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, I 'll make any mistake of mine good," returned Trabue. "The
      paper's all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see," said Alan to the lawyer, "mother and I think father has already
      more of this sort of property than he can carry, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you and yore mother'd let my business alone," broke in Bishop,
      firing up again. "Trabue heer knows I've been worryin' 'im fer the last
      two months to get the property in salable shape. Do you reckon after he
      gets it that away I want to listen to yore two tongues a-waggin' in open
      opposition to it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Trabue rubbed his hands together. "It really don't make a bit of
      difference to me, Alan, one way or the other," he said, pacifically. "I'm
      only acting as attorney for the Tompkins estate, and get my fee whether
      there's a transfer or not. That's where I stand in the matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it's not whar I stand in it, Mr. Trabue," said a firm voice in the
      doorway. It was Mrs. Bishop, her blue eyes flashing, her face pale and
      rigid. "I think I've got a right&mdash;and a big one&mdash;to have a
      say-so in this kind of a trade. A woman 'at 's stayed by a man's side fer
      thirty odd yeer an' raked an' scraped to he'p save a little handful o'
      property fer her two children has got a right to raise a rumpus when her
      husband goes crooked like Alfred has an' starts in to bankrupt 'em all
      jest fer a blind notion o' his'n."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, thar you are!" said Bishop, lifting his eyes from the paper and
      glaring at her over his glasses. "I knowed I'd have to have a
      knock-down-an'-drag-out fight with you 'fore I signed my name, so sail in
      an' git it over. Trabue's got to ride back to town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But whar in the name o' common-sense is the money to come from?" the
      woman hurled at her husband, as she rested one of her bony hands on the
      edge of the table and glared at him. "As I understand it, thar's about
      five thousand acres in this piece alone, an' yo're a-payin' a dollar a
      acre. Whar's it a-comin' from, I'd like to know? Whar's it to come from?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop sniffed and ran a steady hand over his short, gray hair. "You see
      how little she knows o' my business," he said to the lawyer. "Heer she's
      raisin' the devil an' Tom Walker about the trade an' she don't so much as
      know whar the money's to come from."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How <i>was</i> I to know?" retorted the woman, "when you've been tellin'
      me fer the last six months that thar wasn't enough in the bank to give the
      house a coat o' fresh paint an' patch the barn roof."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You knowed I had five thousand dollars wuth o' stock in the Shoal River
      Cotton Mills, didn't you?" asked Bishop, defiantly, and yet with the
      manner of a man throwing a missile which he hoped would fall lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I knowed that, but&mdash;" The woman's eyes were two small fires
      burning hungrily for information beyond their reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it happens that Shoal stock is jest the same on the market as ready
      money, up a little to-day an' down to-morrow, but never varyin' more'n a
      fraction of a cent on the dollar, an' so the Tompkins heirs say they'd
      jest as lieve have it, an' as I'm itchin' to relieve them of the'r land,
      it didn't take us long to come together."
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had struck the woman squarely in the face, she could not have shown
      more surprise. She became white to the lips, and with a low cry turned to
      her son. "Oh, Alan, don't&mdash;don't let 'im do it, it's all we have left
      that we can depend on! It will ruin us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, father, surely," protested Alan, as he put his arm around his
      mother, "surely you can't mean to let go your mill investment which is
      paying fifteen per cent, to put the money into lands that may never
      advance in value and always be a dead weight on your hands! Think of the
      loss of interest and the taxes to be kept up. Father, you must listen to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to nothin'," thundered Bishop, half rising from his chair. "Nobody
      axed you two to put in. It's my business an' I'm a-goin' to attend to it.
      I believe I'm doin' the right thing, an' that settles it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The right thing," moaned the old woman, as she sank into a chair and
      covered her face with her hands. "Mr. Trabue," she went on, fiercely,
      "when that factory stock leaves our hands we won't have a single thing to
      our names that will bring in a cent of income. You kin see how bad it is
      on a woman who has worked as hard to do fer her children as I have. Mr.
      Bishop always said Adele, who is visitin' her uncle's family in Atlanta,
      should have that stock for a weddin'-gift, ef she ever married, an' Alan
      was to have the lower half of this farm. Now what would we have to give
      the girl&mdash;nothin' but thousands o' acres o' hills, mountains an'
      gulches full o' bear, wild-cats, and catamounts&mdash;land that it ud
      break any young couple to hold on to&mdash;much less put to any use. Oh, I
      feel perfectly sick over it."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a heavy, dragging step in the hall, and a long, lank man of
      sixty or sixty-five years of age paused in the doorway. He had no beard
      except a tuft of gray hair on his chin, and his teeth, being few and far
      between, gave to his cheeks a hollow appearance. He was Abner Daniel, Mrs.
      Bishop's bachelor brother, who lived in the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello!" he exclaimed, shifting a big quid of tobacco from one cheek to
      the other; "plottin' agin the whites? Ef you are, I 'll decamp, as the
      feller said when the bull yeerlin' butted 'im in the small o' the back.
      How are you, Mr. Trabue? Have they run you out o' town fer some o' yore
      legal rascality?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon your sister thinks it's rascality that's brought me out to-day,"
      laughed the lawyer. "We are on a little land deal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, I 'll move on," said Abner Daniel. "I jest wanted to tell Alan
      that Rigg's hogs got into his young corn in the bottom jest now an' rooted
      up about as many acres as Pole Baker's ploughed all day. Ef they'd
      a-rooted in straight rows an' not gone too nigh the stalks they mought 'a'
      done the crap more good than harm, but the'r aim or intention, one or
      t'other, was bad. Folks is that away; mighty few of 'em root&mdash;when
      they root at all&mdash;fer anybody but the'rse'ves. Well, I 'll git along
      to my room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't go, brother Ab," pleaded his sister. "I want you to he'p me stand
      up fer my rights. Alfred is about to swap our cotton-mill stock fer some
      more wild mountain-land."
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his natural tendency to turn everything into a jest&mdash;even
      the serious things of life&mdash;the sallow face of the tall man
      lengthened. He stared into the faces around him for a moment, then a slow
      twinkle dawned in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've never been knowed to take sides in any connubial tustle yet," he
      said to Trabue, in a dry tone. "Alf may not know what he's about right
      now, but he's Solomon hisse'f compared to a feller that will undertake to
      settle a dispute betwixt a man an' his wife&mdash;more especially the
      wife. Geewhilikins! I never shall forget the time old Jane Hardeway come
      heer to spend a week an' Alf thar an' Betsy split over buyin' a hat-rack
      fer the hall. Betsy had seed one over at Mason's, at the camp-ground, an'
      determined she'd have one. Maybe you noticed that fancy contraption in the
      hall as you come in. Well, Alf seed a nigger unloadin' it from a wagon at
      the door one mornin', an' when Betsy, in feer an' tremblin', told 'im what
      it was fer he mighty nigh had a fit. He said his folks never had been
      above hangin' the'r coats an' hats on good stout nails an' pegs, an' as
      fer them umbrella-pans to ketch the drip, he said they was fancy
      spit-boxes, an' wanted to know ef she expected a body to do the'r chawin'
      an' smokin' in that windy hall. He said it jest should not stand thar with
      all them prongs an' arms to attack unwary folks in the dark, an' he toted
      it out to the buggy-shed. That got Betsy's dander up an' she put it back
      agin the wall an' said it ud stay thar ef she had to stand behind it an'
      hold it in place. Alf wasn't done yet; he 'lowed ef they was to have sech
      a purty trick as that on the hill it had to stay in the best room in the
      house, so he put it heer in the parlor by the piano. But Betsy took it
      back two or three times an' he larnt that he was a-doin' a sight o' work
      fer nothin', an' finally quit totin' it about. But that ain't what I
      started in to tell. As I was a-sayin', old Jane Hardeway thought she'd
      sorter put a word in the dispute to pay fer her board an' keep, an' she
      told Betsy that it was all owin' to the way the Bishops was raised that
      Alf couldn't stand to have things nice about 'im. She said all the Bishops
      she'd ever knowed had a natural stoop that they got by livin' in cabins
      with low roofs. She wasn't spreadin' 'er butter as thick as she thought
      she was&mdash;ur maybe it was the sort she was spreadin '&mdash;fer Betsy
      blazed up like the woods afire in a high wind. It didn't take old Jane
      long to diskiver that thar was several breeds o' Bishops out o' jail, an'
      she spent most o' the rest o' her visit braggin' on some she'd read about.
      She said the name sounded like the start of 'em had been religious an'
      substanch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brother Abner," whined Mrs. Bishop, "I wisht you'd hush all that
      foolishness an' help me 'n the children out o' this awful fix. Alfred
      always would listen to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," and the old man smiled, and winked at the lawyer, "I 'll give you
      both all the advice I kin. Now, the Shoal River stock is a good thing
      right now; but ef the mill was to ketch on fire an' burn down thar'd be a
      loss. Then as fer timber-land, it ain't easy to sell, but it mought take a
      start before another flood. I say it mought, an' then agin it moughtn't.
      The mill mought burn, an' then agin it moughtn't. Now, ef you-uns kin be
      helped by this advice you are welcome to it free o' charge. Not changin'
      the subject, did you-uns know Mrs. Richardson's heffer's got a calf? I
      reckon she won't borrow so much milk after hers gits good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Trabue smiled broadly as the gaunt man withdrew; but his amusement was
      short-lived, for Mrs. Bishop began to cry, and she soon rose in despair
      and left the room. Alan stood for a moment looking at the unmoved face of
      his father, who had found something in the last clause of the document
      which needed explanation; then he, too, went out.

    <p>
      LAN found his uncle on the back porch washing his face and hands in a
      basin on the water-shelf. The young man leaned against one of the wooden
      posts which supported the low roof of the porch and waited for him to
      conclude the puffing, sputtering operation, which he finally did by
      enveloping his head in a long towel hanging from a wooden roller on the
      weather-boarding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he laughed, "yore uncle Ab didn't better matters in thar overly
      much. But what could a feller do? Yore pa's as bull-headed as a young
      steer, an' he's already played smash anyway. Yore ma's wastin' breath; but
      a woman seems to have plenty of it to spare. A woman' s tongue's like a
      windmill&mdash;it takes breath to keep it a-goin', an' a dead calm ud kill
      her business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's no laughing matter, Uncle Ab," said Alan, despondently. "Something
      must have gone wrong with father's judgment. He never has acted this way
      before."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man dropped the towel and thrust his long, almost jointless
      fingers into his vest pocket for a horn comb which folded up like a
      jack-knife. "I was jest a-wonderin'," as he began to rake his shaggy hair
      straight down to his eyes&mdash;"I was jest a-wonderin' ef he could 'a'
      bent his skull in a little that time his mule th'owed 'im agin the
      sweet-gum. They say that often changes a body powerful. Folks do think
      he's off his cazip on the land question, an' now that he's traded his best
      nest-egg fer another swipe o' the earth's surface, I reckon they 'll talk
      harder. But yore pa ain't no fool; no plumb idiot could 'a' managed yore
      ma as well as he has. You see I know what he's accomplished, fer I've been
      with 'em ever since they was yoked together. When they was married she was
      as wild as a buck, an' certainly made our daddy walk a chalk-line; but
      Alfred has tapered 'er down beautiful. She didn't want this thing done one
      bit, an' yet it is settled by this time"&mdash;the old man looked through
      the hall to the front gate&mdash;"yes, Trabue's unhitchin'; he's got them
      stock certificates in his pocket, an' yore pa has the deeds in his
      note-case. When this gits out, moss-backs from heer clean to Gilmer 'll be
      trapsin' in to dispose o' land at so much a front foot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what under high heaven will he do with it all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold on to it," grinned Abner, "that is, ef he kin rake an' scrape enough
      together to pay the taxes. Why, last yeer his taxes mighty nigh floored
      'im, an' the expenses on this county he's jest annexed will push 'im like
      rips; fer now, you know, he 'll have to do without the income on his
      factory stock; but he thinks he's got the right sow by the yeer. Before
      long he may yell out to us to come he'p 'im turn 'er loose, but he's
      waltzin' with 'er now."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Mrs. Bishop came out of the dining-room wiping her eyes
      on her apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother," said Alan, tenderly, "try not to worry over this any more than
      you can help."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your pa's gettin' old an' childish," whimpered Mrs. Bishop. "He's heerd
      somebody say timber-land up in the mountains will some day advance, an' he
      forgets that he's too old to get the benefit of it. He's goin' to bankrupt
      us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ef I do," the man accused thundered from the hall, as he strode out, "it
      'll be my money that's lost&mdash;money that I made by hard work."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood before them, glaring over his eye-glasses at his wife. "I've had
      enough of yore tongue, my lady; ef I'd not had so much to think about in
      thar jest now I'd 'a' shut you up sooner. Dry up now&mdash;not another
      word! I'm doin' the best I kin accordin' to my lights to provide fer my
      children, an' I won't be interfered with."
    </p>
    <p>
      No one spoke for a moment. However, Mrs. Bishop finally retorted, as her
      brother knew she would, in her own time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't call buyin' thousands o' acres o' unsalable land providin' fer
      anything, except the pore-house," she fumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's beca'se you don't happen to know as much about the business as I
      do," said Bishop, with a satisfied chuckle, which, to the observant
      Daniel, sounded very much like exultation. "When you all know what I know
      you 'll be laughin' on t'other sides o' yore mouths."
    </p>
    <p>
      He started down the steps into the yard as if going to the row of
      bee-hives along the fence, but paused and came back. He had evidently
      changed his mind. "I reckon," he said, "I 'll jest <i>have</i> to let you
      all know about this or I won't have a speck o' peace from now on. I didn't
      tell you at fust beca'se nobody kin keep a secret as well as the man it
      belongs to, an' I was afeerd it ud leak out an' damage my interests; but
      this last five thousand acres jest about sweeps all the best timber in the
      whole Cohutta section, an' I mought as well let up. I reckon you all know
      that ef&mdash;I say <i>ef</i>&mdash;my land was nigh a railroad it ud be
      low at five times what I paid fer it, don't you? Well, then! The long an'
      short of it is that I happen to be on the inside an' know that a railroad
      is goin' to be run from Blue Lick Junction to Darley. It 'll be started
      inside of the next yeer an' 'll run smack dab through my property. Thar
      now, you know more'n you thought you did, don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The little group stared into his glowing face incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A railroad is to be built, father?" exclaimed Alan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what I said."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bishop's eyes flashed with sudden hope, and then, as if remembering
      her husband's limitations, her face fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alfred," she asked, sceptically, "how does it happen that you know about
      the railroad before other folks does?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do I? That's it now&mdash;how do I?" and the old man laughed freely.
      "I've had my fun out o' this thing, listenin' to what every crank said
      about me bein' cracked, an' so on; but I was jest a-lyin' low waitin' fer
      my time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I 'll be switched!" ejaculated Abner Daniel, half seriously, half
      sarcastically. "Geewhilikins! a railroad! I've always said one would pay
      like rips an' open up a dern good, God-fersaken country. I'm glad you are
      a-goin' to start one, Alfred."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan's face was filled with an expression of blended doubt and pity for
      his father's credulity. "Father," he said, gently, "are you sure you got
      your information straight?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I got it from headquarters." The old man raised himself on his toes and
      knocked his heels together, a habit he had not indulged in for many a
      year. "It was told to me confidentially by a man who knows all about the
      whole thing, a man who is in the employ o' the company that's goin' to
      build it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh!" the exclamation was Abner Daniel's, "do you mean that Atlanta
      lawyer, Perkins?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop stared, his mouth lost some of its pleased firmness, and he ceased
      the motion of his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What made you mention his name?" he asked, curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I dunno; somehow I jest thought o' him. He looks to me like he mought
      be buildin' a railroad ur two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's the man I mean," said Bishop, more uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow the others were all looking at Abner Daniel, who grunted suddenly
      and almost angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't trust that skunk no furder'n I could fling a bull by the
      tail."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say you wouldn't?" Bishop tried to smile, but the effort was a facial
      failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't trust 'im nuther, brother Ab," chimed in Mrs. Bishop. "As soon
      as I laid eyes on 'im I knowed he wouldn't do. He's too mealy-mouthed an'
      fawnin'. Butter wouldn't melt in his mouth; he bragged on ever'thing we
      had while he was heer. Now, Alfred, what we must git at is, what was his
      object in tellin' you that tale."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Object?" thundered her husband, losing his temper in the face of the
      awful possibility that her words hinted at. "Are you all a pack an' passle
      o' fools? If you must dive an' probe, then I 'll tell you he owns a slice
      o' timber-land above Holley Creek, j'inin' some o' mine, an' so he let me
      into the secret out o' puore good will. Oh, you all cayn't skeer me; I
      ain't one o' the skeerin' kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      But, notwithstanding this outburst, it was plain that doubt had actually
      taken root in the ordinarily cautious mind of the crude speculator. His
      face lengthened, the light of triumph went out of his eyes, leaving the
      shifting expression of a man taking desperate chances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner Daniel laughed out harshly all at once and then was silent. "What's
      the matter?" asked his sister, in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was jest a-wonderin'," replied her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are?" said Bishop, angrily. "It seems to me you don't do much else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Folks 'at wonders a lot ain't so apt to believe ever'thing they heer,"
      retorted Abner. "I was just a-wonderin' why that little, spindle-shanked
      Peter Mosely has been holdin' his head so high the last week or so. I 'll
      bet I could make a durn good guess now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What under the sun's Peter Mosely got to do with my business?" burst from
      Bishop's impatient lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's got a sorter roundabout connection with it, I reckon," smiled Abner,
      grimly. "I happen to know that Abe Tompkins sold 'im two thousand acres o'
      timber-land on Huckleberry Ridge jest atter yore Atlanta man spent the day
      lookin' round in these parts."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop was no fool, and he grasped Abner's meaning even before it was
      quite clear to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Looky heer," he said, sharply, "what do you take me fur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'ain't tuck you fer nothin'," said Abner, with a grin. "Leastwise,
      I'ain't tuck you fer five thousand dollars' wuth o' cotton-mill stock. To
      make a long story short, the Atlanta jack-leg lawyer is akin to the
      Tompkins family some way. I don't know exactly what kin, but Joe
      Tompkins's wife stayed at Perkins's house when she was down thar havin' er
      spine straightened. I'd bet a new hat to a ginger-cake that Perkins never
      owned a spoonful o' land up heer, an' that he's jest he'pin' the Tompkins
      folks on the sly to unload some o' the'r land, so they kin move West, whar
      they've always wanted to go. Peter Mosely is a man on the watch-out fer
      rail soft snaps, an' when Perkins whispered the big secret in his yeer,
      like he did to you, he started out on a still hunt fer timbered land on
      the line of the proposed trunk line due west vy-ah Lickskillet to Darley,
      with stop-over privileges at Buzzard Roost, an' fifteen minutes fer hash
      at Dog Trot Springs. Then, somehow or other, by hook or crook&mdash;mostly
      crook&mdash;Abe Tompkins wasn't dodgin' anybody about that time; Peter
      Mosely could 'a' run agin 'im with his eyes shut on a dark night. I was at
      Neil Fulmore's store when the two met, an' ef a trade was ever made
      quicker betwixt two folks it was done by telegraph an' the paper was
      signed by lightnin'. Abe said he had the land an' wouldn't part with it at
      any price ef he hadn't been bad in need o' money, fer he believed it was
      chuck-full o' iron ore, soapstone, black marble, an' water-power, to say
      nothin' o' timber, but he'd been troubled so much about cash, he said,
      that he'd made up his mind to let 'er slide an' the devil take the
      contents. I never seed two parties to a deal better satisfied. They both
      left the store with a strut. Mosely's strut was the biggest, fer he wasn't
      afeerd o' nothin'. Tompkins looked like he was afeerd Mosely ud call 'im
      back an' want to rue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean to say&mdash;" But old Bishop seemed unable to put his growing
      fear into words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't know nothin' fer certain," said Abner Daniel,
      sympathetically; "but ef I was you I'd go down to Atlanta an' see Perkins.
      You kin tell by the way he acts whether thar's anything in his railroad
      story or not; but, by gum, you ort to know whar you stand. You've loaded
      yorese'f from hind to fore quarters, an' ef you don't plant yore feet on
      some'n you 'll go down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop clutched this proposition as a drowning man would a straw. "Well, I
      will go see 'im," he said. "I 'll go jest to satisfy you. As fer as I'm
      concerned, I know he wasn't tellin' me no lie; but I reckon you all never
      'll rest till you are satisfied."
    </p>
    <p>
      He descended the steps and crossed the yard to the barn. They saw him lean
      over the rail fence for a moment as if in troubled thought, and then he
      seemed to shake himself, as if to rid himself of an unpleasant mental
      burden, and passed through the little sagging gate into the stable to feed
      his horses. It was now noon. The sun was shining broadly on the fields,
      and ploughmen were riding their horses home in their clanking harnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor father," said Alan to his uncle, as his mother retired slowly into
      the house. "He seems troubled, and it may mean our ruin&mdash;absolute
      ruin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It ain't no triflin' matter," admitted Daniel. "Thar's no tellin' how
      many thousand acres he may have bought; he's keepin' somethin' to hisse'f.
      I remember jest when that durn skunk of a lawyer put that flea in his
      yeer. They was at Hanson's mill, an' talked confidential together mighty
      nigh all mornin'. But let's not cross a bridge tell we git to it. Let's
      talk about some'n else. I hain't never had a chance to tell you, but I
      seed that gal in town yesterday, an' talked to 'er."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you, Uncle Ab?" the face of the young man brightened. His tone was
      eager and expectant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I'd hitched in the wagon-yard an' run into Hazen's drug-store to git
      a box o' axle-grease, an' was comin' out with the durn stuff under my arm
      when I run upon 'er a-settin' in a buggy waitin' to git a clerk to fetch
      'er out a glass o' sody-water. She recognized me, an' fer no other earthly
      reason than that I'm yore uncle she spoke to me as pleasin' as a basket o'
      chips. What was I to do? I never was in such a plight in my life. I'd been
      unloadin' side-meat at Bartow's warehouse, an' was kivered from head to
      foot with salt and grease. I didn't have on no coat, an' the seat o' my
      pants was non est&mdash;I don't think thar was any est about 'em, to tell
      the truth; but I knowed it wouldn't be the part of a gentleman to let 'er
      set thar stretchin' 'er neck out o' socket to call a clerk when I was
      handy, so I wheeled about, hopin' an' prayin' ef she did look at me she'd
      take a fancy to the back o' my head, an' went in the store an' told 'em to
      git a hustle on the'r-se'ves. When I come out, she hauled me up to ax some
      questions about when camp-meetin' was goin' to set in this yeer, and when
      Adele was comin' home. I let my box o' axle-grease drap, an' it rolled
      like a wagon-wheel off duty, an' me after it, bendin'&mdash;<i>bendin</i>'
      of all positions&mdash;heer an' yan in the most ridiculous way. I tell you
      I'd never play croquet ur leapfrog in them pants. All the way home I
      thought how I'd disgraced you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you are all right, Uncle Ab," laughed Alan. "She's told me several
      times that she likes you very much. She says you are genuine&mdash;genuine
      through and through, and she's right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd ruther have her say it than any other gal I know," said Abner. "She's
      purty as red shoes, an', ef I'm any judge, she's genuwine too. I've got
      another idee about 'er, but I ain't a-givin' it away jest now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean that she&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," and the old man smiled mischievously, "I didn't mean nothin' o' the
      sort. I wonder how on earth you could 'a' got sech a notion in yore head.
      I'm goin' to see how that black scamp has left my cotton land. I 'll bet
      he hain't scratched it any deeper'n a old hen would 'a' done lookin' fer
      worms."

      HE next morning at breakfast Alfred Bishop announced his intention of
      going to Atlanta to talk to Perkins, and incidentally to call on his
      brother William, who was a successful wholesale merchant in that city.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe I would," said Mrs. Bishop. "Maybe William will tell you what
      to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd see Perkins fust," advised Abner Daniel. "Ef I felt shore Perkins had
      buncoed me I'd steer cleer o' William. I'd hate to heer 'im let out on
      that subject. He's made his pile by keepin' a sharp lookout."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hain't had no reason to think I have been lied to," said Bishop,
      doggedly, as he poured his coffee into his saucer and shook it about to
      cool. "A body could hear his death-knell rung every minute ef he'd jest
      listen to old women an'&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old bachelors," interpolated Abner. "I reckon they <i>are</i> alike. The
      longer a man lives without a woman the more he gits like one. I reckon
      that's beca'se the man 'at lives with one don't see nothin' wuth copyin'
      in 'er, an' vice-a-versy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bishop had never been an appreciative listener to her brother's
      philosophy. She ignored what he had just said and its accompanying smile,
      which was always Abner's subtle apology for such observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you goin' to tell Adele about the railroad?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon I won't tell 'er to git up a' excursion over it,'fore the
      cross-ties is laid," retorted Bishop, sharply, and Abner Daniel laughed&mdash;that
      sort of response being in his own vein.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was goin' to say," pursued the softly treading wife, "that I wouldn't
      mention it to 'er, ef&mdash;ef&mdash;Mr. Perkins ain't to be relied on,
      beca'se she worries enough already about our pore way o' livin' compared
      to her uncle's folks. Ef she knowed how I spent last night she'd want to
      come back. But I ain't a-goin' to let brother Ab skeer me yet. It is jest
      too awful to think about. What on earth would we do? What would we, I
      say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon Bishop was driven to Darley by a negro boy who was to bring
      the buggy back home. He first repaired to a barber-shop, where he was
      shaved, had his hair cut, and his shoes blacked; then he went to the
      station half an hour before time and impatiently walked up and down the
      platform till the train arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was six o'clock when he reached Atlanta and made his way through the
      jostling crowd in the big passenger depot out into the streets. He had his
      choice of going at once to the residence of his brother, on Peachtree
      Street, the most fashionable avenue of the city, or looking up Perkins in
      his office. He decided to unburden his mind by at once calling on the
      lawyer, whose office was in a tall building quite near at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the hour at which Perkins usually left for home, but the old
      planter found him in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's you, Mr. Bishop," he said, suavely, as he rose from his desk in
      the dingy, disordered little room with its single window. He pushed a
      chair forward. "Sit down; didn't know you were in town. At your brother's,
      I reckon. How are the crops up the road? Too much rain last month, I'm
      afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop sank wearily into the chair. He had tired himself out thinking over
      what he would say to the man before him and with the awful contemplation
      of what the man might say to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are doin' as well as can be expected," he made answer; but he didn't
      approve of even that platitude, for he was plain and outspoken, and hadn't
      come all that distance for a mere exchange of courtesies. Still, he lacked
      the faculty to approach easily the subject which had grown so heavy within
      the last twenty-four hours, and of which he now almost stood in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's good," returned Perkins. He took up a pen as he resumed his
      seat, and began to touch it idly to the broad nail of his thumb. He was a
      swarthy man of fifty-five or sixty, rather tall and slender, with a bald
      head that sloped back sharply from heavy, jutting brows, under which a
      pair of keen, black eyes shone and shifted. "Come down to see your
      daughter," he said. "Good thing for her that you have a brother in town.
      By-the-way, he's a fine type of a man. He's making headway, too; his trade
      is stretching out in all directions&mdash;funny how different you two are!
      He seems to take to a swallow-tail coat and good cigars like a duck to
      water, while you want the open sky above you, sweet-smelling fields
      around, an' fishing, hunting, sowing, reaping, and chickens&mdash;fat,
      juicy ones, like your wife fried when I was there. And her apple-butter!
      Ice-cream can' t hold a candle to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'lowed I'd see William 'fore I went back," said Bishop, rather
      irrelevantly, and, for the lack of something else to do, he took out his
      eye-glasses and perched them on his sharp nose, only, on discovering the
      inutility of the act, to restore them clumsily to his pocket. He was
      trying to persuade himself, in the silence that followed, that, if the
      lawyer had known of his trade with the Tompkins heirs, he would naturally
      have alluded to it. Then, seeing that Perkins was staring at him rather
      fixedly, he said&mdash;it was a verbal plunge: "I bought some more
      timber-land yesterday!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you did? That's good." Perkins's eyes fluttered once or twice before
      his gaze steadied itself on the face of the man before him. "Well, as I
      told you, Mr. Bishop, that sort of a thing is a good investment. I reckon
      it's already climbing up a little, ain't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much yet." It struck Bishop that he had given the lawyer a splendid
      opportunity to speak of the chief cause for an advance in value, and his
      heart felt heavier as he finished. "But I took quite a slice the last time&mdash;five
      thousand acres at the old figure, you know&mdash;a dollar a acre."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't say! That <i>was</i> a slice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop drew himself up in his chair and inhaled a deep breath. It was as
      if he took into himself in that way the courage to make his next remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I got it from the Tompkins estate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't say. I didn't know they had that much on hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a certain skill displayed in the lawyer's choice of questions
      and observations that somehow held him aloof from the unlettered man, and
      there was, too, something in his easy, bland manner that defied the open
      charge of underhand dealing, and yet Bishop had not paid out his railroad
      fare for nothing. He was not going back to his home-circle no wiser than
      when he left it. His next remark surprised himself; it was bluntness
      hardened by despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sence I bought the land I've accidentally heerd that you are some kin o'
      that family."
    </p>
    <p>
      Perkins started slightly and raised his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes; on my wife's side, away off, some way or other. I believe the
      original Tompkins that settled there from Virginia was my wife's
      grandfather. I never was much of a hand to go into such matters."
    </p>
    <p>
      The wily lawyer had erected as strong a verbal fence as was possible on
      such short notice, and for a moment it looked as if Bishop's frankness
      would not attempt to surmount it; but it did, in a fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I heerd that, Perkins, it was natural fer me to wonder why you, you
      see&mdash;why you didn't tell <i>them</i> about the railroad."
    </p>
    <p>
      The sallow features of the lawyer seemed to stiffen. He drew himself up
      coldly and a wicked expression flashed in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take my advice, old man," he snarled, as he threw down his pen and stared
      doggedly into Bishop's face, "stick to your farming and don't waste your
      time asking a professional lawyer questions which have no bearing on your
      business whatever. Now, really, do I have to explain to you my personal
      reasons for not favoring the Tompkins people with a&mdash;I may say&mdash;any
      piece of information?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop was now as white as death; his worst suspicions were confirmed; he
      was a ruined man; there was no further doubt about that. Suddenly he felt
      unable to bridle the contemptuous fury that raged within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I know <i>why</i> you didn't tell 'em," was what he hurled at the
      lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it was beca'se you knowed no road was goin' to be built. You told
      Pete Mosely the same tale you did me, an' Abe Tompkins unloaded on 'im.
      That's a way you have o' doin' business."
    </p>
    <p>
      Perkins stood up. He took his silk hat from the top of his desk and put it
      on. "Oh yes, old man," he sneered, "I'm a terribly dishonest fellow; but
      I've got company in this world. Now, really, the only thing that has
      worried me has been your unchristian act in buying all that land from the
      Tompkins heirs at such a low figure when the railroad will advance its
      value so greatly. Mr. Bishop, I thought you were a good Methodist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you kin laugh an' jeer all you like," cried Bishop, "but I can handle
      you fer this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not as well versed in the law as you are in fertilizers, Mr.
      Bishop," sneered the lawyer. "In order to make a case against me, you'd
      have to publicly betray a matter I told to you in confidence, and then
      what would you gain? I doubt if the court would force me to explain a
      private matter like this where the interests of my clients are concerned.
      And if the court did, I could simply show the letters I have regarding the
      possible construction of a railroad in your section. If you remember
      rightly, I did not say the thing was an absolute certainty. On top of all
      this, you'd be obliged to prove collusion between me and the Tompkins
      heirs over a sale made by their attorney, Mr. Trabue. There is one thing
      certain, Mr. Bishop, and that is that you have forfeited your right to any
      further confidence in this matter. If the road is built you 'll find out
      about it with the rest of your people. You think you acted wisely in
      attacking me this way, but you have simply cut off your nose to spite your
      face. Now I have a long car-ride before me, and it's growing late."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop stood up. He was quivering as with palsy. His voice shook and rang
      like that of a madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a scoundrel, Perkins," he said&mdash;"a dirty black snake in the
      grass. I want to tell you that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I hope you won't make any charge for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it's free." Bishop turned to the door. There was a droop upon his
      whole body. He dragged his feet as he moved out into the unlighted
      corridor, where he paused irresolutely. So great was his agony that he
      almost obeyed an impulse to go back and fall at the feet of Perkins and
      implore his aid to rescue him and his family from impending ruin. The
      lawyer was moving about the room, closing his desk and drawing down the
      window-shade. Up from the street came the clanging of locomotive bells
      under the car-shed, the whir of street-cars, the clatter of cabs on the
      cobble-stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's no use," sighed Bishop, as he made his way down-stairs. "I'm ruined&mdash;Alan
      an' Adele hain't a cent to their names, an' that devil&mdash;" Bishop
      paused on the first landing like an animal at bay. He heard the steady
      step of Perkins on the floor above, and for a moment his fingers tingled
      with the thought of waiting there in the darkness and choking the life out
      of the subtle scoundrel who had taken advantage of his credulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with a groan that was half a prayer he went on down the steps and out
      into the lighted streets. At the first corner he saw a car which would
      take him to his brother's, and he hastened to catch it.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Bishop's house was a modern brick structure, standing on a
      well-clipped lawn which held a gothic summer-house and two or three marble
      statues. It was in the best portion of the avenue. Reaching it, the
      planter left the car and approached the iron gate which opened on to the
      granite steps leading up the terrace. It was now quite dark and many
      pedestrians were hurrying homeward along the sidewalks. Obeying a sudden
      impulse, the old man irresolutely passed by the gate and walked farther up
      the street. He wanted to gain time, to think whether it would be best for
      him in his present state of mind to meet those fashionable relatives&mdash;above
      all, his matter-of-fact, progressive brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somehow I don't feel one bit like it," he mused. "I couldn't tell
      William. He'd think I wanted to borrow money an' ud git skeerd right off.
      He always was afeerd I'd mismanage. An' then I'd hate to sp'ile Adele's
      visit, an' she could tell thar was some'n wrong by me bein' heer in sech a
      flurry. I reckon I <i>do</i> show it. How could a body he'p it? Oh, my
      Lord, have mercy! It's all gone, all&mdash;all me'n Betsy has saved."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned at the corner of his brother's property and slowly retraced his
      halting steps to the gate, but he did not pause, continuing his way back
      towards the station. A glance at the house showed that all the lower rooms
      were lighted, as well as the big prismatic lamp that hung over the front
      door. Bishop saw forms in light summer clothing on the wide veranda. "I
      'll bet that tallest one is Sis," he said, pathetically. "I jest wish I
      could see 'er a little while. Maybe it ud stop this awful hurtin' a little
      jest to look at 'er an' heer 'er laugh like she always did at home. She'd
      be brave; she wouldn't cry an' take on; but it would hurt 'er away down in
      'er heart, especially when she's mixin' with sech high-flyers an'
      money-spenders. Lord, what 'll I do fer cash to send 'er next month? I'm
      the land-porest man in my county."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he went along he passed several fashionable hotels, from which
      orchestral music came. Through the plate-glass windows he saw men and
      women, amid palms and flowers, dining in evening dress and sparkling
      jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the station, he inquired about a train to Darley, and was told
      that one left at midnight. He decided to take it, and in the mean time he
      would have nothing to occupy him. He was not hungry; the travel and worry
      had killed his appetite; but he went into a little caf across the street
      from the depot and ordered a sandwich and a cup of coffee. He drank the
      coffee at a gulp, but the food seemed to stick in his throat. After this
      he went into the waiting-room, which was thronged with tired women holding
      babies in their arms, and roughly clad emigrants with packs and oil-cloth
      bags. He sat in one of the iron-armed seats without moving till he heard
      his train announced, and then he went into the smoking-car and sat down in
      a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached Darley at half-past three in the morning and went to the only
      hotel in the place. The sleepy night-clerk rose from his lounge behind the
      counter in the office and assigned him to a room to which a colored boy,
      vigorously rubbing his eyes, conducted him. Left alone in his room, he sat
      down on the edge of his bed and started to undress, but with a sigh he
      stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the use o' me lyin' down almost at daybreak?" he asked himself. "I
      mought as well be on the way home. I cayn't sleep nohow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Blowing out his lamp, he went down-stairs and roused the clerk again.
      "Will I have to pay fer that bed ef I don't use it?" he questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, no, Mr. Bishop," said the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I believe I 'll start out home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is your team in town?" asked the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The team I'm a-goin' to use is. I'm goin' to foot it. I've done the like
      before this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's a purty tough stretch," smiled the clerk. "But the roads are
      good."

      T was a little after sunrise; the family had just left the breakfast-table
      when Bishop walked in; his shoes and trousers were damp with dew and
      covered with the dust of the road. His wife saw him entering the gate and
      called out to him from the hall:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I declare! Didn't you go to Atlanta?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He came slowly up the steps, dragging his feet after him. He had the
      appearance of a man beaten by every storm that could fall upon a human
      being.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I went," he said, doggedly. He passed her and went into the
      sitting-room, where his brother-inlaw stood at the fireplace lighting his
      pipe with a live coal of fire on the tip of a stick. Abner Daniel looked
      at him critically, his brows raised a little as he puffed, but he said
      nothing. Mrs. Bishop came in behind her husband, sweeping him from head to
      foot with her searching eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mean to tell me you walked out heer this mornin'," she cried.
      "Lord have mercy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know as I've prepared any set speech on the subject," said her
      husband, testily; "but I walked. I could 'a' gone to a livery an' ordered
      out a team, but I believe thar's more'n one way o' wearin' sackcloth an'
      ashes, an' the sooner I begin the better I 'll feel." Abner Daniel winked;
      the scriptural allusion appealed to his fancy, and he smiled impulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That thar is," he said. "Thar's a whole way an' a half way. Some folks
      jest wear it next to the skin whar it don't show, with broadcloth ur silk
      on the outside. They think ef it scratches a little that 'll satisfy the
      Lord an' hoodwink other folks. But I believe He meant it to be whole hog
      or none."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bishop was deaf to this philosophy. "I don't see," she said, in her
      own field of reflection&mdash;"I don't see, I say, how you got to Atlanta;
      attended to business; seed Adele; an' got back heer at sunrise. Why,
      Alfred&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bishop interrupted her. "Have you all had prayers yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you know we hain't," said his wife, wondering over his strange
      manner. "I reckon it can pass jest this once, bein' as you are tired an'
      hain't had nothin' to eat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it can't pass, nuther; I don't want to touch a mouthful; tell the
      rest of 'em to come in, an' you fetch me the Book."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!" Mrs. Bishop went out and told the negro woman and her daughter to
      stop washing the dishes and go in to prayer. Then she hurried out to the
      back porch, where Alan was oiling his gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something's happened to yore pa," she said. "He acts queer, an' says sech
      strange things. He walked all the way from Darley this morning, an' now
      wants to have prayers 'fore he touches a bite o' breakfast. I reckon we
      are ruined."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid that's it," opined her son, as he put down his gun and
      followed her into the sitting-room. Here the two negroes stood against the
      wall. Abner Daniel was smoking and Bishop held the big family Bible on his
      quivering knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ef you mean to keep it up," Abner was saying, argumentatively, "all right
      an' good; but I don't believe in sudden spurts o' worship. My hosses is
      hitched up ready to haul a load o' bark to the tannery, an' it may throw
      me a little late at dinner; but ef you are a-goin' to make a daily
      business of it I'm with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a-goin' to be regular from now on," said Bishop, slowly turning the
      leaves of the tome. "I forgot whar I read last."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't finish about Samson tyin' all them foxes' tails together,"
      said Abner Daniel, as he knocked the hot ashes from his pipe into the palm
      of his hand and tossed them into the chimney. "That sorter interested me.
      I wondered how that was a-goin' to end. I'd hate to have a passle o' foxes
      with torches to the'r tails turned loose in my wheat jest 'fore cuttin'
      time. It must 'a' been a sight. I wondered how that was a-goin' to end."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You 'll wonder how <i>yo're</i> a-goin' to end if you don't be more
      respectful," said his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like the foxes, I reckon," grinned Abner, "with a eternal torch tied to
      me. Well, ef I am treated that away, I 'll go into the business o'
      destruction an' set fire to everything I run across."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ain' t you goin' to tell us what you did in Atlanta 'fore you have
      prayer?" asked Mrs. Bishop, almost resentfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I hain't!" Bishop snapped. "I 'll tell you soon enough. I reckon I
      won't read this mornin'; let's pray."
    </p>
    <p>
      They all knelt reverently, and yet with some curiosity, for Bishop often
      suited his prayers to important occasions, and it struck them that he
      might now allude to the subject bound up within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord, God Almighty," he began, his lower lip hanging and quivering, as
      were his hands clasped in the seat of his chair, "Thou knowest the
      struggle Thy creatures are makin' on the face of Thy green globe to live
      up to the best of the'r lights an' standards. As I bend before Thee this
      mornin' I realize how small a bein' I am in Thy sight, an' that I ort to
      bow in humble submission to Thy will, an' I do. For many yeers this family
      has enjoyed Thy bounteous blessings. We've had good health, an' the
      influence of a Bible-readin', God-fearin' community, an' our childern has
      been educated in a way that raised 'em head an' shoulders above many o'
      the'r associates an' even blood kin. I don't know exactly whar an' how
      I've sinned; but I know I have displeased Thee, fer Thy scourge has fallen
      hard an' heavy on my ambitions. I wanted to see my boy heer, a good,
      obedient son, an' my daughter thar in Atlanta, able to hold the'r heads up
      among the folks they mix with, an' so I reached out. Maybe it was
      forbidden fruit helt out by a snake in the devil's service. I don't know&mdash;Thou
      knowest. Anyways, I steered my course out o' the calm waters o' content
      an' peace o' soul into the whirlpool rapids o' avarice an' greed. I'lowed
      I was in a safe haven an' didn't dream o' the storm-clouds hangin' over me
      till they bust in fury on my head. Now, Lord, my Father, give them hearts
      of patience an' forgiveness fer the blunders of Thy servant. What I done,
      I done in the bull-headed way that I've always done things; but I meant
      good an' not harm. These things we ask in the name o' Jesus Christ, our
      blessed Lord an' Master. Amen."
    </p>
    <p>
      During the latter part of the prayer Mrs. Bishop had been staring at her
      husband through her parted fingers, her face pale and agitated, and as she
      rose her eyes were glued to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Alfred," she said, "what are you goin' to tell us about the
      railroad? Is it as bad as brother Ab thought it would be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop hesitated. It seemed as if he had even then to tear himself from
      the clutch of his natural stubbornness. He looked into all the anxious,
      waiting faces before he spoke, and then he gave in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ab made a good guess. Ef I'd 'a' had his sense, or Alan' s, I'd 'a' made
      a better trader. It's like Ab said it was, only a sight wuss&mdash;a
      powerful sight wuss!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wuss?" gasped his wife, In fresh alarm. "How could it be wuss? Why,
      brother Ab said&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never have told you the extent o' my draim's," went on Bishop in the
      current of confession. "I never even told Perkins yesterday. Fust an' last
      I've managed to rake in fully twenty thousand acres o' mountain-land. I
      was goin' on what I'lowed was a dead-shore thing. I secured all I could
      lay my hands on, an' I did it in secret. I was afeerd even to tell you
      about what Perkins said, thinkin' it mought leak out an' sp'ile my
      chances."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, father," said Alan, "you didn't have enough money to buy all that
      land."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I got it up"&mdash;Bishop's face was doggedly pale, almost defiant of his
      overwhelming disaster&mdash;"I mortgaged this farm to get money to buy
      Maybry and Morton's four thousand acres."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The farm you was going to deed to Alan?" gasped his wife. "You didn't
      include that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in <i>that</i> deal," groaned Bishop. "I swapped that to Phil Parsons
      fer his poplar an' cypress belt." The words seemed to cut raspingly into
      the silence of the big room. Abner Daniel was the only one who seemed
      unmoved by the confession. He filled his pipe from the bowl on the
      mantel-piece and pressed the tobacco down with his forefinger; then he
      kicked the ashes in the chimney till he uncovered a small five coal. He
      eyed it for a moment, then dipped it up in the shovel, rolled it into his
      pipe, and began to smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I ain't a-goin' to git no yeerly pass over the new road," he said, his
      object being to draw his brother-in-law back to Perkins's action in the
      matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perkins was a-lyin' to me," answered Bishop. "He hain't admitted it yet;
      but he was a-lyin'. His object was to he'p the Tompkins sell out fer a
      decent price, but he can' t be handled; he's got me on the hip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Abner. "I'd ruther keep on swappin' gold dollars fer
      mountain-land an' lettin' it go fer taxes 'an to try to beat a lawyer at
      his own game. A court-house is like the devil's abode, easy to git into,
      no outlet, an' nothin' but scorch while you are thar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, fer the name o' goodness!" cried Mrs. Bishop, looking at her
      husband. "Don't you see he's dyin' from it? Are you all a-goin' to kill
      'im? What does a few acres o' land ur debts amount to beside killin' a man
      'at's been tryin' to help us all? Alfred, it ain't so mighty awful. You
      know it ain't! What did me 'n' you have when we started out but a
      log-house boarded up on the outside? an' now we've got our childern
      educated an' all of us in good health. I railly believe it's a sin agin
      God's mercy fer us to moan an' fret under a thing like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the talk," exclaimed Abner Daniel, enthusiastically. "Now you are
      gittin' down to brass tacks. I've always contended&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For God's sake, don't talk that way!" said Bishop to his wife. "You don't
      mean a word of it. You are jest a-sayin' it to try to keep me from seein'
      what a fool I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't worry about me, father," said Alan, firmly. "I am able to
      look out for myself an' for you and mother. It's done, and the best thing
      to do is to look at it in a sensible way. Besides, a man with twenty
      thousand acres of mountain-land paid for is not broken, by a long jump."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I'm gone," said Bishop, a wavering look of gratitude in his eye as
      he turned to his son. "I figured on it all last night. I can't pay the
      heavy interest an' come out. I was playin' for big stakes an' got left.
      Thar's nothin' to do but give up. Me buyin' so much land has made it rise
      a little, but when I begin to try to sell I won't be able to give it
      away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thar's some'n in that," opined Abner Daniel, as he turned to leave the
      room. "I reckon I mought as well go haul that tan-bark. I reckon you won't
      move out 'fore dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan followed him out to the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's pretty tough, Uncle Ab," he said. "I hadn't the slightest idea it
      was so bad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wasn't so shore," said Daniel. "But I was jest a-thinkin' in thar.
      You've got a powerful good friend in Rayburn Miller. He's the sharpest
      speculator in North Georgia; ef I was you, I'd see him an' lay the whole
      thing before him. He 'll be able to give you good advice, an' I'd take it.
      A feller that's made as much money as he has at his age won't give a
      friend bad advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought of him," said Alan; "but I am a little afraid he will think we
      want to borrow money, and he never lets out a cent without the best
      security."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you needn't be afeerd on that score," laughed the old man, as he
      reached up on the high wagon-seat for his whip. "I once heerd 'im say that
      business an' friendship wouldn't mix any better'n oil an' water."

      HE following Saturday Alan went to Darley, as he frequently did, to spend
      Sunday. On such visits he usually stayed at the Johnston House, a great,
      old-fashioned brick building that had survived the Civil War and remained
      untouched by the shot and shell that hurtled over it during that dismal
      period when most of the population had "refugeed farther south." It had
      four stories, and was too big for the town, which could boast of only two
      thousand inhabitants, one-third of whom were black. However, the smallness
      of the town was in the hotel's favor, for in a place where no one would
      have patronized a second-class hotel, opposition would have died a natural
      death. The genial proprietor and his family were of the best blood, and
      the Johnston House was a sort of social club-house, where the church
      people held their affairs and the less serious element gave dances. To be
      admitted to the hotel without having to pay for one's dinner was the
      hallmark of social approval. It was near the ancient-looking brick
      car-shed under which the trains of two main lines ran, and a long freight
      warehouse of the same date and architecture. Around the hotel were
      clustered the chief financial enterprises of the town&mdash;its stores,
      post-office, banks, and a hall for theatrical purposes. Darley was the
      seat of its county, and another relic of the days before the war was its
      court house. The principal sidewalks were paved with brick, which in
      places were damp and green, and sometimes raised above their common level
      by the undergrowing roots of the sycamore-trees that edged the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the office of the hotel, just after registering his name, Alan met his
      friend Rayburn Miller, for whose business ability, it may be remembered,
      Abner Daniel had such high regard. He was a fine-looking man of
      thirty-three, tall and of athletic build; he had dark eyes and hair, and a
      ruddy, out-door complexion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello," he said, cordially. "I thought you might get in to-day, so I came
      round to see. Sorry you've taken a room. I wanted you to sleep with me
      to-night. Sister's gone, and no one is there but the cook. Hello, I must
      be careful. I'm drumming for business right under Sanford's nose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll make you stay with me to make up for it," said Alan, as the clerk
      behind the counter laughed good-naturedly over the allusion to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blamed if I don't think about it," said Miller. "Come round to the
      office. I want to talk to you. I reckon you've got every plough going such
      weather as this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Took my horse out of the field to drive over," said Alan, as they went
      out and turned down to a side street where there was a row of law offices,
      all two-roomed buildings, single-storied, built of brick, and bearing
      battered tin signs. One of these buildings was Miller's, which, like all
      its fellows, had its door wide open, thus inviting all the lawyers in the
      "row" and all students of law to enter and borrow books or use the
      ever-open desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rayburn Miller was a man among ten thousand in his class. Just after being
      graduated at the State University he was admitted to the bar and took up
      the practice of law. He could undoubtedly have made his way at this alone,
      had not other and more absorbing talents developed within him. Having had
      a few thousand dollars left him at his father's death, he began to utilize
      this capital in "note shaving," and other methods of turning over money
      for a handsome profit furnished by the unsettled conditions, the time, and
      locality. He soon became an adept in many lines of speculation, and as he
      was remarkably shrewd and cautious, it is not to be wondered at that he
      soon accumulated quite a fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take a seat," he said to Alan, as they went into the office, and he threw
      himself into the revolving-chair at his littered desk. "I want to talk to
      you. I suppose you are in for some fun. The boys are getting up a dance at
      the hotel and they want your dollar to help pay the band. It's a good one
      this time. They've ordered it from Chattanooga. It will be down on the
      seven-thirty-five. Got a match?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan had not, and Miller turned his head to the open door. An old negro
      happened to be passing, with an axe on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heigh, there, Uncle Ned!" Miller called out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The negro had passed, but he heard his name called and he came back and
      looked in at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Want me, Marse Rayburn?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you old scamp; get me a match or I 'll shoot the top of your head
      off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, suh; all right, Marse Rayburn!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought to know him," said Miller, with a smile, as the negro hurried
      into the adjoining office. "His wife cooks for Colonel Barclay; he might
      tell you if Miss Dolly's going to-night, but I know she is. Frank
      Hillhouse checked her name off the list, and I heard him say she'd
      accepted. By-the-way, that fellow will do to watch. I think he and the
      Colonel are pretty thick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you never let up on that?" Alan asked with a flush.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know that I shall," laughed Rayburn. "It seems so funny to see
      you in love, or, rather, to see you think you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never said I was," said Alan, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you show it so blamed plain," said Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heer 'tis, Marse Rayburn. Marse Trabue said you could have a whole box ef
      you'd put up wid sulphur ones."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller took the matches from the outstretched hand and tossed a cigar to
      Alan. "Say, Uncle Ned," he asked, "do you know that gentleman?" indicating
      Alan with a nod of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quizzical look dawned in the old negro's eyes, and then he gave a
      resounding guffaw and shook all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon I know his hoss, Marse Rayburn," he tittered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a good one on you, Alan," laughed Miller. "He knows your 'hoss.'I
      'll have to spring that on you when I see you two together."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the negro left the office Mr. Trabue leaned in the doorway, holding his
      battered silk hat in his hand and mopping his perspiring face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded to Alan, and said to Miller: "Do you want to write?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not any more for you, thanks," said Miller. "I have the back-ache now
      from those depositions I made out for you yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't mean that," the old lawyer assured him, "but I had to borrow
      yore ink just now, and seein' you at yore desk I thought you might need
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, if I do," jested Miller, "I can buy another bottle at the book-store.
      They pay me a commission on the ink I furnish the row. They let me have it
      cheap by the case. What stumps me is that you looked in to see if I needed
      it. You are breaking the rule, Mr. Trabue. They generally make me hunt for
      my office furniture when I need it. They've borrowed everything I have
      except my iron safe. Their ignorance of the combination, its weight, and
      their confirmed laziness is all that saved it."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the old lawyer had gone the two friends sat and smoked in silence for
      several minutes. Alan was studying Miller's face. Something told him that
      the news of his father's disaster had reached him, and that Miller was
      going to speak of it. He was not mistaken, for the lawyer soon broached
      the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been intending to ride out to see you almost every day this week,"
      he said, "but business has always prevented my leaving town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you have heard&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Alan, I'm sorry, but it's all over the country. A man's bad luck
      spreads as fast as good war news. I heard it the next day after your
      father returned from Atlanta, and saw the whole thing in a flash. The
      truth is, Perkins had the cheek to try his scheme on me. I'm the first
      target of every scoundrel who has something to sell, and I've learned many
      of their tricks. I didn't listen to all he had to say, but got rid of him
      as soon as I could. You must not blame the old man. As I see it now, it
      was a most plausible scheme, and the shame of it is that no one can be
      handled for it. I don't think the Tompkins heirs knew anything of
      Perkins's plans at all, except that he was to get a commission, perhaps,
      if the property was sold. Trabue is innocent, too&mdash;a cat's-paw. As
      for Perkins, he has kept his skirts clear of prosecution. Your father will
      have to grin and bear it. He really didn't pay a fabulous price for the
      land, and if he were in a condition to hold on to it for, say, twenty-five
      years, he might not lose money; but who can do that sort of thing? I have
      acres and acres of mountain-land offered me at a much lower figure, but
      what little money I've made has been made by turning my capital rapidly.
      Have you seen Dolly since it happened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not for two weeks," replied Alan. "I went to church with her Sunday
      before last, and have not seen her since. I was wondering if she had heard
      about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes; she's heard it from the Colonel. It may surprise you, but the
      thing has rubbed him the wrong way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I don't understand," exclaimed Alan. "Has he&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The old man has had about two thousand acres of land over near your
      father's purchases, and it seems that he was closely watching all your
      father's deals, and, in spite of his judgment to the contrary, Mr.
      Bishop's confidence in that sort of real-estate has made him put a higher
      valuation on his holdings over there. So you see, now that your father's
      mistake is common talk, he is forced to realize a big slump, and he wants
      to blame some one for it. I don't know but that your father or some one
      else made him an offer for his land which he refused. So you see it is
      only natural for him to be disgruntled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said Alan. "I reckon you heard that from Miss Dolly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller smoked slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes"&mdash;after a pause&mdash;"I dropped in there night before last and
      she told me about it. She's not one of your surface creatures. She talks
      sensibly on all sorts of subjects. Of course, she's not going to show her
      heart to me, but she couldn't hide the fact that your trouble was worrying
      her a good deal. I think she'd like to see you at the ball to-night. Frank
      Hillhouse will give you a dance or two. He's going to be hard to beat.
      He's the most attentive fellow I ever run across. He's got a new buggy&mdash;a
      regular hug-me-tight&mdash;and a high-stepping Kentucky mare for the
      summer campaign. He 'll have some money at his father's death, and all the
      old women say he's the best catch in town because he doesn't drink, has a
      Sunday-school class, and will have money. We are all going to wear
      evening-suits to-night. There are some girls from Rome visiting Hattie
      Alexander, and we don't want them to smell hay in our hair. You know how
      the boys are; unless all of us wear spike-tails no one will, so we took a
      vote on it and we 'll be on a big dike. There 'll be a devilish lot of
      misfits. Those who haven't suits are borrowing in all directions. Frank
      Buford will rig out in Colonel Day's antebellum toggery. Did you bring
      yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It happens to be at Parker's shop, being pressed," said Alan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've had three in the last six years," laughed Miller. "You know how much
      larger Todd Selman is than I am; he bursted one of mine from collar to
      waist last summer at the Springs, and sweated so much that you could dust
      salt out of it for a month afterwards. I can't refuse 'em, God bless 'em!
      Jeff Higgins married in my best Prince Albert last week and spilled boiled
      custard on it; but he's got a good wife and a fair job on a railroad in
      Tennessee now. I'd have given him the coat, but he'd never have accepted
      it, and been mad the rest of his life at my offer. Parker said somebody
      had tried to scrape the custard off with a sharp knife, and that he had a
      lot of trouble cleaning it. I wore the coat yesterday and felt like I was
      going to be married. Todd must have left some of his shivers in it I
      reckon that's as near as I 'll ever come to the hitching-post."
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then a tall, thin man entered. He wore a rather threadbare
      frock-coat, unevenly bound with braid, and had a sallow, sunken, and
      rather long face. It was Samuel Craig, one of the two private bankers of
      the town. He was about sixty years of age and had a pronounced stoop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello!" he said, pleasantly; "you young bloods are a-goin' to play smash
      with the gals' hearts to-night, I reckon. I say go it while you are young.
      Rayburn, I want to get one of them iron-clad mortgage-blanks. I've got a
      feller that is disposed to wiggle, an' I want to tie 'im up. The inventor
      of that form is a blessing to mankind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Help yourself," smiled Miller. "I was just telling Mr. Trabue that I was
      running a stationery store, and if I was out of anything in the line I'd
      order it for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The banker laughed good-humoredly as he selected several of the blanks
      from the drawer Rayburn had opened in the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you won't complain as much of hard times as Jake Pitner does," he
      chuckled. "I passed his store the other day, where he was standin' over
      some old magazines that he'd marked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'How's trade?' I asked 'im. 'It's gone clean to hell,' he said, and I
      noticed he'd been drinking. 'I 'll give you a sample of my customers,' he
      went on. 'A feller from the mountains come in jest now an' asked the price
      of these magazines. I told him the regular price was twenty-five cents
      apiece, but I'd marked 'em down to five. He looked at 'em for about half a
      hour an' then said he wasn't goin' out o' town till sundown an' believed
      he'd take one if I'd read it to him.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Craig laughed heartily as he finished the story, and Alan and Miller
      joined in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you to remember that yarn when you get to over-checkin' on me,"
      said Craig, jestingly. "I was just noticing this morning that you have
      drawn more than your deposit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Over-checked?" said Miller. "You 'll think I have when all my checks get
      in. I mailed a dozen to-day. They 'll slide in on you in about a week and
      you 'll telegraph <i>Bradstreet's</i> to know how I stand. This is a <i>fine</i>
      banker," Miller went on to Alan. "He twits me about over-checking
      occasionally. Let me tell you something. Last year I happened to have ten
      thousand dollars on my hands waiting for a cotton factory to begin
      operations down in Alabama, and as I had no idea when the money would be
      called for I placed it with his nibs here 'on call.'Things got in a tangle
      at the mill and they kept waiting, and our friend here concluded I had
      given it to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you had forgotten you had it," said Craig, with another of his
      loud, infectious laughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyway," went on Miller, "I got a sudden order for the amount and ran in
      on him on my way from the post-office. I made out my check and stuck it
      under his nose. Great Scott! you ought to have seen him wilt. I don't
      believe he had half of it in the house, but he had ten million excuses. He
      kept me waiting two days and hustled around to beat the band. He thought I
      was going to close him up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was a close shave," admitted Craig. "Never mind about the
      over-checking, my boy; keep it up, if it will help you. You are doing
      altogether too much business with the other bank to suit me, anyway."

    <p>
      HE young people assembled slowly at the dance that evening. Towards dark
      it had begun raining, and according to custom two livery-stable carriages,
      called "hacks," were engaged to convey all the couples to and from the
      hotel. There was no disputing over who should have the first use of the
      vehicles, for the young ladies who had the reputation of getting ready
      early on such occasions were gone after first, and those who liked to take
      their time in making preparations were left till later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything in life is relative, and to young people who often went to even
      less pretentious entertainments this affair was rather impressive in its
      elegance. Lamps shone everywhere, and bunches of candles blazed and
      sputtered in nooks hung about with evergreens. The girls were becomingly
      attired in light evening-gowns, and many of them were good-looking,
      refined, and graceful. All were soft-spoken and easy in their manners, and
      either wore or carried flowers. The evening-suits of the young men were
      well in evidence, and more noticeable to the wearers themselves than they
      would have been to a spectator used to conventional style of dress. They
      could be seen in all stages of inadaptability to figures too large or too
      small, and even after the dance began there were several swaps, and a due
      amount of congratulation on the improvement from the appreciative fair
      sex. The young lady accompanying each young man had pinned a small bouquet
      on his lapel, so that it would have been impossible to tell whether a man
      had a natural taste for flowers or was the willing victim to a taste
      higher than his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rayburn Miller and Alan sat smoking and talking in the room of the latter
      till about half-past nine o' clock, and then they went down. As a general
      rule, young men were expected to escort ladies to dances, when the young
      men went at all; but Alan was often excused from so doing on account of
      living in the country, and Miller had broken down every precedent in that
      respect and never invited a girl to go with him. He atoned for this
      shortcoming by contributing most liberally to every entertainment given by
      the young people, even when he was out of town. He used to say he liked to
      graze and nibble at such things and feel free to go to bed or business at
      will.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the two friends entered the big parlor, Alan espied the girl about whom
      he had been thinking all day. She was seated in one of the deep,
      lace-curtained windows behind the piano. Frank Hillhouse was just
      presenting to her a faultlessly attired travelling salesman. At this
      juncture one of the floor-managers with a white rosette on his lapel
      called Miller away to ask his advice about some details, and Alan turned
      out of the parlor into the wide corridor which ran through the house. He
      did this in obedience to another unwritten law governing Darley's social
      intercourse&mdash;that it would be impolite for a resident gentleman to
      intrude himself upon a stranger who had just been introduced to a lady. So
      he went down to the ground floor and strolled into the office. It was full
      of tobacco smoke and a throng of men, some of whom were from the country
      and others from the town, drawn to the hotel by the festivities. From the
      office a door opened into a bar and billiard room, whence came the
      clicking of ivory balls and the grounding of cues. Another door led into
      the large dining-room, which had been cleared of its tables that it might
      be used for dancing. There was a sawing of fiddles, the twanging of
      guitars, the jingle of tambourines, and the groaning of a bass-viol. The
      musicians, black and yellow, occupied chairs on one of the tables, which
      had been placed against the wall, and one of the floor-managers was
      engaged in whittling paraffine-candles over the floor and rubbing it in
      with his feet. Seeing what he was doing, some of the young men, desirous
      of trying their new patent-leather pumps, came in and began to waltz
      singly and in couples.
    </p>
    <p>
      When everything was in readiness the floor-managers piloted the dancers
      down-stairs. From the office Alan saw them filing into the big room and
      taking seats in the chairs arranged against the walls on all sides. He saw
      Frank Hillhouse and Dolly Barclay sit down near the band; the salesman had
      disappeared. Alan threw his cigar away and went straight to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, here you are," laughed Frank Hillhouse, as Alan shook hands with her.
      "I told Miss Dolly coming on that the west wind would blow you this way,
      and when I saw Ray Miller just now I knew you'd struck the town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wasn't exactly the wind," replied Alan. "I'm afraid you will forget me
      if I stay on the farm all the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We certainly are glad to have you," smiled Miss Barclay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew she'd say that&mdash;I knew it&mdash;I knew it," said Hillhouse.
      "A girl can always think of nicer things to say to a feller than his rival
      can. Old Squire Trabue was teasing me the other day about how hard you was
      to beat, Bishop, but I told him the bigger the war the more victory for
      somebody; and, as the feller said, I tote fair and am above board."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan greeted this with an all but visible shudder. There was much in his
      dignified bearing and good appearance to commend him to the preference of
      any thinking woman, especially when contrasted to Hill-house, who was only
      a little taller than Dolly, and was showing himself even at a greater
      disadvantage in his unrefined allusions to his and Alan' s attentions to
      her. Indeed, Alan was sorry for the spectacle the fellow was making of
      himself, and tried to pass it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I usually come in on Saturdays," he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true," said Dolly, with one of her rare smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes"&mdash;Hillhouse took another header into forbidden waters&mdash;"he's
      about joined your church, they tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan treated this with an indulgent smile. He did not dislike Hillhouse,
      but he did not admire him, and he had never quite liked his constant
      attentions to Miss Barclay. But it was an acknowledged fact among the
      society girls of Darley that if a girl refused to go out with any young
      man in good standing it was not long before she was left at home oftener
      than was pleasant. Dolly was easily the best-looking girl in the room;
      not, perhaps, the most daintily pretty, but she possessed a beauty which
      strength of character and intellect alone could give to a face already
      well featured. Even her physical beauty alone was of that texture which
      gives the beholder an agreeable sense of solidity. She was well formed,
      above medium height, had a beautiful neck and shoulders, dark-gray eyes,
      and abundant golden-brown hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I see your card?" asked Alan. "I came early to secure at least one."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this Frank Hillhouse burst out laughing and she smiled up at Alan.
      "He's been teasing me all evening about the predicament I'm in," she
      explained. "The truth is, I'm not going to dance at all. The presiding
      elder happened in town to-day, on his way through, and is at our house.
      You know how bitter he is against church-members dancing. At first mamma
      said I shouldn't come a step; but Mr. Hillhouse and I succeeded in getting
      up a compromise. I can only look on. But my friends are having pity on me
      and filling my card for what they call stationary dances."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan laughed as he took the card, which was already almost filled, and
      wrote his name in one of the blank spaces. Some one called Hillhouse away,
      and then an awkward silence fell upon them. For the first time Alan
      noticed a worried expression on her face, now that it was in repose, but
      it lighted up again when she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have no button-hole bouquet," she said, noticing his bare lapel.
      "That's what you get for not bringing a girl. Let me make you one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you would," he said, thoughtfully, for as she began to search
      among her flowers for some rosebuds and leaves he noted again the
      expression of countenance that had already puzzled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since you are so popular," he went on, his eyes on her deft fingers, "I'd
      better try to make another engagement. I'd as well confess that I came in
      town solely to ask you to let me take you to church tomorrow evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her start; she raised her eyes to his almost imploringly, and then
      she looked down. He saw her breast heave suddenly as with tightened lips
      she leaned forward to pin the flowers on his coat. The jewels in her rings
      flashed under his eyes; there was a delicate perfume in the air about her
      glorious head. He had never seen her look so beautiful before. He wondered
      at her silence at just such a moment. The tightness of her lips gave way
      and they fell to trembling when she started to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hardly know what to say," she began. "I&mdash;I&mdash;you know I said
      the presiding elder was at our house, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I understand," broke in Alan; "that's all right. Of course, use your
      own&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I must be plain with you," she broke in, raising a pair of helpless,
      tortured eyes to his; "you will not think I had anything to do with it. In
      fact, my heart is almost broken. I'm very, very unhappy."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still totally at sea as to the cause of her strange distress.
      "Perhaps you'd rather not tell me at all," he said, sympathetically; his
      tone never had been so tender. "You need not, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it's a thing I could not keep from you long, anyway," she said,
      tremulously. "In fact, it is due you&mdash;an explanation, I mean. Oh,
      Alan, papa has taken up the idea that we&mdash;that we like each other too
      much, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The life and soul seemed to leave Alan' s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand," he heard himself saying; "he does not want me to visit you
      any more."
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply; he saw her catch a deep breath, and her eyes went down
      to her flowers. The music struck up. The mulatto leader stood waving his
      fiddle and calling for "the grand march" in loud, melodious tones. There
      was a scrambling for partners; the young men gave their left arms to the
      ladies and merrily dragged them to their places.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you do not blame me&mdash;that you don't think that I&mdash;" but
      the clatter and clamor ingulfed her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not at all," he told her; "but it's awful&mdash;simply awful I I know
      you are a true friend, and that's some sort of comfort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I always shall be," she gulped. "You must try not to feel hurt. You
      know my father is a very peculiar man, and has an awful will, and nobody
      was ever so obstinate."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Alan' s sense of the great injustice of the thing rose up within him
      and his blood began to boil. "Perhaps I ought to take my name off your
      card," he said, drawing himself up slightly; "if he were to hear that I
      talked to you to-night he might make it unpleasant for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you do I shall never&mdash;<i>never forgive you</i>," she answered, in
      a voice that shook. There was, too, a glistening in her eyes, as if tears
      were springing. "Wouldn't that show that you harbored ill-will against me,
      when I am so helpless and troubled?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it would; and I shall come back," he made answer. He rose, for
      Hillhouse, calling loudly over his shoulder to some one, was thrusting his
      bowed arm down towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon," he said to Dolly. "I didn't know they had called the
      march. We've got some ice-cream hid out up-stairs, and some of us are
      going for it. Won't you take some, Bishop?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thank you," said Alan, and they left him.

      LAN made his way along the wall, out of the track of the promenaders, into
      the office, anxious to escape being spoken to by any one. But here several
      jovial men from the mountains who knew him intimately gathered around him
      and began to make laughing remarks about his dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look fer the world like a dirt-dauber." This comparison to a kind of
      black wasp came from Pole Baker, a tall, heavily built farmer with an
      enormous head, thick eyebrows, and long, shaggy hair. He lived on Bishop's
      farm, and had been brought up with Alan. "I 'll be derned ef you ain't
      nimble on yore feet, though. I've seed you cut the pigeon-wing over on
      Mossy Creek with them big, strappin' gals 'fore you had yore sights as
      high as these town folks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's that thar vest that gits me," said another. "I reckon it's cut low
      so you won't drap saft victuals on it; but I guess you don't do much
      eatin' with that collar on. It don't look like yore Adam's-apple could
      stir a peg under it."
    </p>
    <p>
      With a good-natured reply and a laugh he did not feel, Alan hurried out of
      the office and up to his room, where he had left his lamp burning. Rayburn
      Miller's hat and light overcoat were on the bed. Alan sat down in one of
      the stiff-backed, split-bottom chairs and stared straight in front of him.
      Never in his life had he suffered as he was now suffering. He could see no
      hope ahead; the girl he loved was lost to him. Her father had heard of the
      foolhardiness of old man Bishop, and, like many another well-meaning
      parent, had determined to save his daughter from the folly of marrying a
      penniless man, who had doubtless inherited his father's lack of judgment
      and caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a rap on the closed door, and immediately afterwards Rayburn
      Miller turned the knob and came in. His kindly glance swept the face of
      his friend, and he said, with forced lightness:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was doing the cake-walk with that fat Howard girl from Rome when I saw
      you leave the room. She can' t hide the fact that she is from a city of
      ten thousand population. She kept calling my attention to what our girls
      had on and sniggering. She's been to school in Boston and looked across
      the ocean from there. You know I don't think we lead the world, but it
      makes me fighting mad to have our town sneered at. When she was making so
      much fun of the girls' dresses, I came in an inch of asking her if she was
      a dressmaker. By God, I did! You remember," Miller went on lightly, as if
      he had divined Alan' s misery and was trying to cheer him up&mdash;"you
      remember how Percy Lee, Hamilton's shoe-clerk, hit back at that Savannah
      girl. She was stopping in this house for a month one summer, and he called
      on her and took her driving several times; but one day she let herself
      out. 'Everything is so different up here, Mr. Lee,'she giggled. 'Down
      home, girls in good society never receive young men in your business.'It
      was a lick between the eyes; but old North Georgia was ready for it.
      'Oh,'said Percy, whose mother's blood is as blue as indigo, 'the Darley
      girls draw the line, too; I only get to go with hotel girls.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan looked up and smiled, but his face seemed frozen. Miller sat down,
      and an awkward silence fell for several minutes. It was broken by the
      lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to bore you, old man," he said, "but I just had to follow
      you. I saw from your looks as you left the ballroom that something was
      wrong, and I am afraid I know what it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think you do?" asked Alan, flashing a glance of surprise upward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. You see, Colonel Barclay is a rough, outspoken man, and he made a
      remark the other day which reached me. I wasn't sure it was true, so I
      didn't mention it; but I reckon my informant knew what he was talking
      about."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan nodded despondently. "I asked her to go to church with me to-morrow
      night. She was awfully embarrassed, and finally told me of her father's
      objections."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I know what fired the old devil up," said Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it was that mistake of your father's. As I told you, the Colonel is
      as mad as a wet hen about the whole thing. He's got a rope tied to every
      nickel he's got, and he intends to leave Dolly a good deal of money. He
      thinks Frank Hillhouse is just the thing; he shows that as plain as day.
      He noticed how frequently you came to see Dolly and scented danger ahead,
      and simply put his foot down on it, just as fathers have been doing ever
      since the Flood. My dear boy, you've got a bitter pill to take, but you've
      got to swallow it like a man. You've reached a point where two roads fork.
      It is for you to decide which one you 'll take."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan made no reply. Rayburn Miller lighted a cigar and began to smoke
      steadily. There was a sound of boisterous laughter in a room across the
      corridor. It had been set aside as the dressing-room for the male
      revellers, and some of them were there, ordering drinks up from the bar.
      Now and then from below came muffled strains of music and the monotonous
      shuffling of feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's none of my business," Miller burst out, suddenly; "but I'm friend
      enough of yours to feel this thing like the devil. However, I don't know
      what to say. I only wish I knew how far you've gone into it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan smiled mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you can' t look at me and see how far I've gone you are blind," he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mean that," replied Miller. "I was wondering how far you had
      committed yourself&mdash;oh, damn it!&mdash;made love, and all that sort
      of thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've never spoken to her on the subject," Alan informed him, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good, good! Splendid!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan stared in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand," he said. "She knows&mdash;that is, I think she knows
      how I feel, and I have hoped that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind about that," interrupted Miller, laconically. "There is a
      chance for both of you if you 'll turn square around like sensible human
      beings and look the facts in the face."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That it will be stupid, childish idiocy for either or both of you to let
      this thing spoil your lives."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you will before I'm through with you, and I 'll do you up brown.
      There are simply two courses open to you, my boy. One is to treat Colonel
      Barclay's wishes with dignified respect, and bow and retire just as any
      European gentleman would do when told that his pile was too small to be
      considered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the other?" asked Alan, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The other is to follow in the footsteps of nearly every sentimental fool
      that ever was born, and go around looking like a last year's bird's-nest,
      looking good for nothing, and being good for nothing; or, worse yet,
      persuading the girl to elope, and thus angering her father so that he will
      cut her out of what's coming to her and what is her right, my boy. She may
      be willing to live on a bread-and-water diet for a while, but she 'll lose
      flesh and temper in the long run. If you don't make as much money for her
      as you cause her to lose she 'll tell you of it some day, or at least let
      you see it, an' that's as long as it's wide. You are now giving yourself a
      treatment in self-hypnotism, telling yourself that life has not and cannot
      produce a thing for you beyond that particular pink frock and yellow head.
      I know how you feel. I've been there six different times, beginning with a
      terrible long first attack and dwindling down, as I became inoculated with
      experience, till now the complaint amounts to hardly more than a momentary
      throe when I see a fresh one in a train for an hour's ride. I can do you a
      lot of good if you 'll listen to me. I 'll give you the benefit of my
      experience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What good would your devilish experience do me?" said Alan, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would fit any man's case if he'd only believe it. I've made a study of
      love. I've observed hundreds of typical cases, and watched marriage from
      inception through protracted illness or boredom down to dumb resignation
      or sudden death. I don't mean that no lovers of the ideal, sentimental
      brand are ever happy after marriage, but I do believe that open-eyed
      courtship will beat the blind sort all hollow, and that, in nine cases out
      of ten, if people were mated by law according to the judgment of a
      sensible, open-eyed jury, they would be happier than they now are. Nothing
      ever spoken is truer than the commandment, 'Thou shalt have no other God
      but me.'Let a man put anything above the principle of living right and he
      will be miserable. The man who holds gold as the chief thing in life will
      starve to death in its cold glitter, while a pauper in rags will have a
      laugh that rings with the music of immortal joy. In the same way the man
      who declares that only one woman is suited to him is making a god of her&mdash;raising
      her to a seat that won't support her dead, material weight. I frankly
      believe that the glamour of love is simply a sort of insanity that has
      never been correctly named and treated because so many people have been
      the victims of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know," Alan burst in, almost angrily, "when you talk that way I
      think you are off. I know what's the matter with you; you have simply
      frittered away your heart, your ability to love and appreciate a good
      woman. Thank Heaven! your experience has not been mine. I don't see how
      you could ever be happy with a woman. I couldn't look a pure wife in the
      face and remember all the flirtations you've indulged in&mdash;that is, if
      they were mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you go," laughed Miller; "make it personal, that's the only way the
      average lover argues. I am speaking in general terms. Let me finish. Take
      two examples: first, the chap crazily in love, who faces life with the red
      rag of his infatuation&mdash;his girl. No parental objection, everything
      smooth, and a car-load of silverware&mdash;a clock for every room in the
      house. They start out on their honeymoon, doing the chief cities at the
      biggest hotels and the theatres in the three-dollar seats. They soon tire
      of themselves and lay it to the trip. Every day they rake away a handful
      of glamour from each other, till, when they reach home, they have come to
      the conclusion that they are only human, and not the highest order at
      that. For a while they have a siege of discontent, wondering where it's
      all gone. Finally, the man is forced to go about his work, and the woman
      gets to making things to go on the backs of chairs and trying to spread
      her trousseau over the next year, and they begin to court resignation. Now
      if they had not had the glamour attack they would have got down to
      business sooner, that's all, and they would have set a better example to
      other plungers. Now for the second illustration. Poverty on one side,
      boodle on the other; more glamour than in other case, because of the gulf
      between. They get married&mdash;they have to; they've inherited the stupid
      idea that the Lord is at the bottom of it and that the glamour is His
      smile. Like the other couple, their eyes are finally opened to the facts,
      and they begin to secretly wonder what it's all about; the one with the
      spondoolix wonders harder than the one who has none. If the man has the
      money, he will feel good at first over doing so much for his affinity; but
      if he has an eye for earthly values&mdash;and good business men have&mdash;there
      will be times when he will envy Jones, whose wife had as many rocks as
      Jones. Love and capital go together like rain and sunshine; they are
      productive of something. Then if the woman has the money and the man
      hasn't, there's tragedy&mdash;a slow cutting of throats. She is
      irresistibly drawn with the rest of the world into the thought that she
      has tied herself and her money to an automaton, for such men are
      invariably lifeless. They seem to lose the faculty of earning money&mdash;in
      any other way. And as for a proper title for the penniless young idiot
      that publicly advertises himself as worth enough, in himself, for a girl
      to sacrifice her money to live with him&mdash;well, the unabridged does
      not furnish it. Jack Ass in bill-board letters would come nearer to it
      than anything that occurs to me now. I'm not afraid to say it, for I know
      you'd never cause any girl to give up her fortune without knowing, at
      least, whether you could replace it or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan rose and paced the room. "That," he said, as he stood between the
      lace curtains at the window, against which the rain beat steadily&mdash;"that
      is why I feel so blue. I don't believe Colonel Barclay would ever forgive
      her, and I'd die before I'd make her lose a thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right," returned Miller, relighting his cigar at the lamp, "and
      he'd cut her off without a cent. I know him. But what is troubling me is
      that you may not be benefited by my logic. Don't allow this to go any
      further. Let her alone from to-night on and you 'll find in a few months
      that you are resigned to it, just like the average widower who wants to
      get married six months after his loss. And when she is married and has a
      baby, she 'll meet you on the street and not care a rap whether her hat's
      on right or not. She 'll tell her husband all about it, and allude to you
      as her first, second, or third fancy, as the case may be. I have faith in
      your future, but you've got a long, rocky row to hoe, and a thing like
      this could spoil your usefulness and misdirect your talents. If I could
      see how you could profit by waiting I'd let your flame burn unmolested;
      but circumstances are agin us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd already seen my duty," said Alan, in a low tone, as he came away from
      the window. "I have an engagement with her later, and the subject shall be
      avoided."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good man!" Miller's cigar was so short that he stuck the blade of his
      penknife through it that he might enjoy it to the end without burning his
      fingers. "That's the talk! Now I must mosey on down-stairs and dance with
      that Miss Fewclothes from Rome&mdash;the one with the auburn tresses, that
      says 'delighted' whenever she is spoken to."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan went back to the window. The rain was still beating on it. For a long
      time he stood looking out into the blackness. The bad luck which had come
      to his father had been a blow to him; but its later offspring had the
      grim, cold countenance of death itself. He had never realized till now
      that Dolly Barclay was so much a part of his very life. For a moment he
      almost gave way to a sob that rose and struggled within him. He sat down
      again and clasped his hands before him in dumb self-pity. He told himself
      that Rayburn Miller was right, that only weak men would act contrary to
      such advice. No, it was over&mdash;all, all over.

    <p>
      FTER the dance Frank Hillhouse took Dolly home in one of the drenched and
      bespattered hacks. The Barclay residence was one of the best-made and
      largest in town. It was an old-style Southern frame-house, painted white,
      and had white-columned verandas on two sides. It was in the edge of the
      town, and had an extensive lawn in front and almost a little farm behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly's mother had never forgotten that she was once a girl herself, and
      she took the most active interest in everything pertaining to Dolly's
      social life. On occasions like the one just described she found it
      impossible to sleep till her daughter returned, and then she slipped
      up-stairs, and made the girl tell all about it while she was disrobing.
      To-night she was more alert and wide-awake than usual. She opened the
      front door for Dolly and almost stepped on the girl's heels as she
      followed her up-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it nice?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, very," Dolly replied. Reaching her room, she turned up the
      low-burning lamp, and, standing before a mirror, began to take some
      flowers out of her hair. Mrs. Barclay sat down on the edge of the
      high-posted mahogany bed and raised one of her bare feet and held it in
      her hand. She was a thin woman with iron-gray hair, and about fifty years
      of age. She looked as if she were cold; but, for reasons of her own, she
      was not willing for Dolly to remark it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who was there?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, everybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so? I thought a good many would stay away because it was a bad
      night; but I reckon they are as anxious to go as we used to be. Then you
      all did have the hacks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, they had the hacks." There was a pause, during which one pair of
      eyes was fixed rather vacantly on the image in the mirror; the other pair,
      full of impatient inquiry, rested alternately on the image and its maker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe you had a good time," broke the silence, in a rising,
      tentative tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I did, mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what's the matter with you?" Mrs. Barclay's voice rang with
      impatience. "I never saw you act like you do to-night, never in my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't know anything was wrong with me, mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You act queer; I declare you do," asserted Mrs. Barclay. "You generally
      have a lot to say. Have you and Frank had a falling out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly gave her shoulders a sudden shrug of contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, we got along as well as we ever did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought maybe he was a little mad because you wouldn't dance to-night;
      but surely he's got enough sense to see that you oughtn't to insult
      brother Dill-beck that way when he's visiting our house and everybody
      knows what he thinks about dancing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he thought I did right about it," said Dolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what in the name of common-sense is the matter with you, Dolly? You
      can' t pull the wool over my eyes, and you needn't try it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly faced about suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon you 'll sit there all night unless I tell you all about it," she
      said, sharply. "Mother, Alan Bishop was there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't say!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and asked me to let him take me to church to-morrow evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he did?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and as I didn't want father to insult him, I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You told him what your pa said?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I just told him father didn't want me to receive him any more. Heaven
      knows, that was enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that was the best thing for you to do." Mrs. Barclay took a deep
      breath, as if she were inhaling a delicious perfume. "It's much better
      than to have him plunge in here some day and have your father break out
      like he does in his rough way. What did Alan say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said very little; but he looked it. You ought to have seen him. Frank
      came up just about that time and invited me to have some ice-cream, and I
      had to leave him. He was as white as a sheet. He had made an engagement
      with me to sit out a dance, and he didn't come in the room again till that
      dance was called, and then he didn't even mention it. He acted so
      peculiarly, I could see it was nearly killing him, but he wouldn't let me
      bring up the subject again. I came near doing it; but he always steered
      round it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a sensible young man," declared Mrs. Barclay. "Any one can see that
      by looking at him. He's not responsible for his father's foolhardy
      venture, but it certainly leaves him in a bad fix as a marrying man. He's
      had bad luck, and he must put up with the consequences. There are plenty
      of girls who have no money or prospects who would be glad to have him, but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother," broke in Dolly, as if she had been listening to her own troubled
      thoughts rather than her mother's words; "he didn't act as if he wanted to
      see me alone. The other couples who had engagements to talk during that
      dance were sitting in windows and out-of-the-way corners, but he kept me
      right where I was, and was as carefully polite as if we had just been
      introduced. I was sorry for him and mad at the same time. I could have
      pulled his ears."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's sensible, very sensible," said Mrs. Barclay, in a tone of warm
      admiration. "A man like that ought to get along, and I reckon he will do
      well some day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, mother," said Dolly, her rich, round voice rising like a wave and
      breaking in her throat, "he may never think about me any more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that really would be best, dear, under the circumstances."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Best?" Dolly blurted out. "How can you say that, when&mdash;when&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dolly, you are not really foolish about him, are you?" Mrs. Barclay's
      face dropped into deeper seriousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly looked away and was silent for a moment; then she faltered: "I don't
      know, mother, I&mdash;I'm afraid if I keep on feeling like I do now I 'll
      never get over it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, but you 'll not keep on feeling like you do now," consoled the older
      woman. "Of course, right now, just after seeing how hard he took it, you
      will kind o' sympathize with him and want to help him; but that will all
      pass away. I remember when I was about your age I had a falling out with
      Will Despree&mdash;a young man my father didn't like because his
      grandfather had been an overseer. And, do you know, I thought I would
      actually kill myself. I refused to eat a bite and threatened to run away
      with Will. To this day I really don't know what I would have done if your
      grandfather hadn't scared him away with a shot-gun. Will kept writing
      notes to me. I was afraid to answer them, but my father got hold of one
      and went after him on a fast horse. Will's family heard what was up and
      they kept him out in the swamp for a few days, and then they sent him to
      Texas. The whole Despree family took it up and talked scand'lous about
      us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you soon got over it, mother?" asked Dolly, almost in a tone of
      dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Mrs. Barclay, reflectively, "Will acted the fool so terribly;
      he wasn't out in Texas three months before he sent back a marked paper
      with an article in it about his engagement to the daughter of a rich man
      who, we found out afterwards, used to keep a livery-stable; then I reckon
      hardly any girl would keep caring for a boy when his folks was telling
      such lies about her family."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly was staring studiously at the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother," she asked, "don't you believe in real love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Barclay laughed as if highly amused. "I believe in a different sort
      to the puppy love I had for that boy. Then after that there was another
      young man that I thought more of, if anything, than I did of Will; but he
      was as poor as Job's turkey, and my folks was all crazy for me 'n' your
      pa, who I'd never seen, to get married. I held out against the idea, just
      like you are doing with Frank, I reckon; but when your pa come with his
      shiny broadcloth coat and spotted silk vest&mdash;no, it was satin, I
      think, with red spots on it&mdash;and every girl in town was crazy to
      catch him, and there was no end of reports about the niggers he owned and
      his high connections&mdash;well, as I say, it wasn't a week before I was
      afraid he'd see Joe Tinsley and hear about me 'n' him. My father was in
      for the match from the very jump, and so was your pa's folks. He put up at
      our house with his nigger servant and didn't want to go about town much. I
      reckon I was pleased to have him pick me out, and so we soon fixed it up.
      Lordy, he only had to mention Joe Tinsley to me after we got married to
      make me do anything he wanted. To this day he throws him up to me, for Joe
      never did amount to anything. He tried to borrow money from your pa after
      you was born. The neighbors had to feed his children."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you loved father, didn't you?" Dolly breathed, in some relief over
      what she thought was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I can' t say I did," said Mrs. Barclay. "We had a terrible time
      getting used to one another's ways. You see, he'd waited a good while, and
      was some older than I was. After a while, though, we settled down, and now
      I'm awful glad I let my father manage for me. You see, what your pa had
      and what my father settled on me made us comfortable, and if a couple is
      that it's a sight more than the pore ones are."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly stood before her mother, close enough to touch her. Her face wore an
      indescribable expression of dissatisfaction with what she had heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother, tell me one thing," she said. "Did you ever let either of those
      boys&mdash;the two that you didn't marry, I mean&mdash;kiss you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Barclay stared up at her daughter for an instant and then her face
      broke into a broad smile of genuine amusement. She lowered her head to her
      knee and laughed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dolly Barclay, you are <i>such</i> a fool!" she said, and then she
      laughed again almost immoderately, her face in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know what <i>that</i> means," said Dolly, in high disgust. "Mother, I
      don't think you can do me any good. You'd better go to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Barclay rose promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I'd better, too," she said. "It makes your pa awful mad for me to
      sit up this way. I don't want to hear him rail out like he always does
      when he catches me at it."
    </p>
    <p>
      After her mother had gone, Dolly sat down on her bed. "She never was in
      love," she told herself. "Never, never, never! And it is a pity. She never
      could have talked that way if she had really loved anybody as much as&mdash;"
      But Dolly did not finish what lay on her tongue. However, when she had
      drawn the covers up over her the cold tears rose in her eyes and rolled
      down on her pillow as she thought of Alan Bishop's brave and dignified
      suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor fellow!" she said. "Poor, dear Alan!"

    <p>
      HERE is a certain class of individuals that will gather around a man in
      misfortune, and it differs very little, if it differs at all, from the
      class that warms itself in the glow of a man' s prosperity. It is made up
      of human failures, in the first instance, congratulating themselves on not
      being alone in bad luck; in the second, desirous of seeing how a fortunate
      man would look and act and guessing at his feelings. From the appearance
      of Bishop's home for the first fortnight after his return from Atlanta,
      you would have thought that some one was seriously ill in the house or
      that some general favorite had returned to the family after a long
      absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horses were hitched to the fence from the front gate all the way round to
      the side entrance. The mountain people seemed to have left their various
      occupations to subtly enjoy the spectacle of a common man like themselves
      who had reached too far after forbidden fruit and lay maimed and torn
      before them. It was a sort of feast at which the baser part of their
      spiritual natures was fed, and, starved as they were, it tasted good. Many
      of them had never aspired to bettering their lot even with small ventures
      such as buying Jersey cows at double the value of common cattle when it
      was reported that the former gave four times as much milk and ate less,
      and to these cautious individuals Bishop's visible writhing was sweet
      confirmation of their own judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their disapproval of the old man's effort to hurry Providence could not
      have been better shown than in the failure of them all to comment on the
      rascally conduct of the Atlanta lawyer; they even chuckled over that part
      of the incident. To their minds Perkins was a sort of far-off
      personification of a necessary evil&mdash;who, like the devil himself, was
      evidently created to show mortals their limitations. They were not going
      to say what the lawyer had a right to do or should avoid doing, for they
      didn't pretend to know; but they did know what their old neighbor ought to
      have done, and if they didn't tell him so to his face they would let him
      see it by their actions. Yes, Bishop was a different thing altogether. He
      belonged to them and theirs. He led in their meetings, prayed in public,
      and had till now headed the list in all charitable movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Charles B. Dole, a tall, spare man of sixty, who preached the
      first, second, third, and fourth Sundays of each month in four different
      meetinghouses within a day's ride of Bishop's, came around as the guest of
      the farm-house as often as his circuit would permit. He was called the
      "fightin' preacher," because he had had several fearless hand-to-hand
      encounters with certain moonshiners whose conduct he had ventured to call
      ungodly, because unlawful.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second Saturday after Bishop's mishap, as Dole was to preach the
      next day at Rock Crest meetinghouse, he rode up as usual and turned his
      horse into the stable and fed him with his own hands. Then he joined Abner
      Daniel on the veranda. Abner had seen him ride up and purposely buried his
      head in his newspaper to keep from offering to take the horse, for Abner
      did not like the preacher "any to hurt," as he would have put it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dole did not care much for Abner either. They had engaged in several
      doctrinal discussions in which the preacher had waxed furious over some of
      Daniel's views, which he described as decidedly unorthodox. Daniel had
      kept his temper beautifully and had the appearance of being amused through
      it all, and this Dole found harder to forgive than anything Abner had
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You all have had some trouble, I heer, sence I saw you last," said the
      preacher as he sat down and began to wipe his perspiring brow with a big
      handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I reckon it mought be called that," Abner replied, as he carefully
      folded his newspaper and put it into his coat-pocket. "None of us was
      expectin' of it an' it sorter bu'sted our calculations. Alf had laid out
      to put new high-back benches in Rock Crest, an' new lamps an' one thing
      another, an' it seems to me"&mdash;Abner wiped his too facile mouth&mdash;"like
      I heerd 'im say one day that you wasn't paid enough fer yore thunder, an'
      that he'd stir around an' see what could be done." Abner's eyes twinkled.
      "But lawsy me! I reckon ef he kin possibly raise the scads to pay the tax
      on his investment next yeer he 'll do all the Lord expects."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh, I reckon!" grunted Dole, irritated as usual by Abner's double
      meaning. "I take it that the Lord hain't got much to do with human
      speculations one way or other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ef I just had that scamp that roped 'im in before me a minute I'd fix
      'im," said Abner. "Do you know what denomination Perkins belongs to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't," Dole blurted out, "an' what's more, I don't care."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I acknowledge it sorter interests me," went on our philosopher, in
      an inscrutable tone, "beca'se, brother Dole, you kin often trace a man' s
      good ur bad doin' s to his belief in Bible matters. Maybe you don't
      remember Jabe Lynan that stold Thad Wilson's stump-suckin' hoss an' was
      ketched an' put up. I was at the court-house in Darley when he received
      his sentence. His wife sent me to 'im to carry his pipe an' one thing or
      other&mdash;a pair o' socks an' other necessary tricks&mdash;a little can
      o' lye-soap, fer one thing. She hadn't the time to go, as she said she had
      a patch o' young corn to hoe out. I found 'im as happy as ef he was goin'
      off on a excursion. He laughed an' 'lowed it ud be some time 'fore he got
      back, an' I wondered what could 'a' made him so contented, so I made some
      inquiries on that line. I found that he was a firm believer in
      predestination, an' that what was to be was foreordained. He said that he
      firmly believed he was predestinated to go to the coal-mines fer
      hoss-stealin', an' that life was too short to be kickin' agin the Lord's
      way o' runnin' matters; besides, he said, he'd heerd that they issued a
      plug o'.tobacco a week to chawin' prisoners, an' he could prove that he
      was one o' that sort ef they'd look how he'd ground his jaw-teeth down to
      the gums."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh!" grunted Dole again, his sharp, gray eyes on Abner's face, as if he
      half believed that some of his own theories were being sneered at. It was
      true that he, being a Methodist, had not advocated a belief in
      predestination, but Abner Daniel had on more than one occasion shown a
      decided tendency to bunch all stringent religious opinions together and
      cast them down as out of date. When in doubt in a conversation with Abner,
      the preacher assumed a coldness on the outside that was often not
      consistent with the fires within him. "I don't see what all that's got to
      do with brother Bishop's mistake," he said, frigidly, as he leaned back in
      his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It sets me to wonderin' what denomination Perkins belongs to, that's
      all," said Abner, with another smile. "I know in reason he's a big Ike in
      some church in Atlanta, fer I never knowed a lawyer that wasn't foremost
      in that way o' doin' good. I 'll bet a hoe-cake he belongs to some
      highfalutin crowd o' worshippers that kneel down on saft cushions an'
      believe in scoopin' in all they kin in the Lord's name, an' that charity
      begins at home. I think that myse'f, brother Dole, fer thar never was a
      plant as hard to git rooted as charity is, an' a body ought to have it
      whar they kin watch it close. It 'll die a heap o' times ef you jest look
      at it, an' it mighty nigh always has bad soil ur a drougth to contend
      with."
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Pole Baker, who has already been introduced to the reader, rode
      up to the fence and hitched his horse. He nodded to the two men on the
      veranda, and went round to the smoke-house to get a piece of bacon Bishop
      had promised to sell him on credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh!" Dole grunted, and he crossed his long legs and swung his foot up
      and down nervously. He had the look of a man who was wondering why such
      insufferable bores as Abner should so often accompany a free dinner. He
      had never felt drawn to the man, and it irritated him to think that just
      when his mental faculties needed rest, Abner always managed to introduce
      the very topics which made it necessary for him to keep his wits about
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take that feller thar," Abner went on, referring to Baker. "He's about
      the hardest customer in this county, an' yet he's bein' managed right now.
      He's got a wife an' seven children an' is a holy terror when he gits
      drunk. He used to be the biggest dare-devil moonshiner in all these
      mountains; but Alan kept befriendin' 'im fust one way an' another tell he
      up one day an' axed Alan what he could do fer 'im. Alan ain't none o' yore
      shoutin' kind o' Christians. He shakes a nimble toe at a shindig when he
      wants to, an' knows the ace from a ten-spot; but he gits thar with every
      claw in the air when some 'n' has to be done. So, when Pole axed 'im that,
      Alan jest said, as quiet as ef he was axin' 'im fer a match to light a
      cigar, 'Quit yore moonshinin', Pole.' That was all he said. Pole looked
      'im straight in the eye fer a minute, an' then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The hell you say! By God, Alan Bishop, you don't mean that!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yes, I do, Pole,' said Alan, 'quit! Quit smack off!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You ax that as a favor?' said Pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yes, as a favor,' said Alan, 'an' you are a-goin' to do it, too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then Pole begun to contend with 'im. 'You are a-axin' that beca'se you
      think I 'll be ketched up with,' he said; 'but I tell you the' ain't no
      man on the face o' the earth that could find my still now. You could stand
      in two feet of the door to it all day an' not find it if you looked fer it
      with a spy-glass. I kin make bug-juice all the rest o' my life an' sell it
      without bein' ketched.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I want you to give it up,' said Alan, an' Pole did. It was like pullin'
      an eye-tooth, but Pole yanked it out. Alan is workin' on 'im now to git
      'im to quit liquor, but that ain't so easy. He could walk a crack with a
      gallon sloshin' about in 'im. Now, as I started to say, Alan 'ain't got no
      cut-and-dried denomination, an' don't have to walk any particular kind o'
      foot-log to do his work, but it's a-goin' on jest the same. Now I don't
      mean no reflection on yore way o' hitchin' wings on folks, but I believe
      you could preach yore sermons&mdash;sech as they are&mdash;in Pole Baker's
      yeers till Gabriel blowed his lungs out, an' Pole ud still be moonshinin'.
      An' sometimes I think that sech fellers as Alan Bishop ort to be paid fer
      what they do in betterin' the world. I don't see why you fellers ort
      always to be allowed to rake in the jack-pot unless you'd accomplish
      more'n outsiders, that jest turn the'r hands to the job at odd times."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dole drew himself up straight and glared at the offender.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think that is a rather personal remark, brother Daniel," he said,
      coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, maybe it is," returned Abner; "but I didn't mean fer it to be. I've
      heerd you praise up certain preachers fer the good they was a-doin', an' I
      saw no harm in mentionin' Alan's method. I reckon it's jest a case o' the
      shoe bein' on another foot. I was goin' to tell you how this misfortune o'
      Alf's had affected Pole; he's been like a crazy man ever since it
      happened. It's been all Alan could do to keep 'im from goin' to Atlanta
      and chokin' the life out o' Perkins. Pole got so mad when he wouldn't let
      'im go that he went off cussin' 'im fer all he was worth. I wonder what
      sort of a denomination a man ud fit into that 'll cuss his best friends
      black an' blue beca'se they won't let 'im fight fer 'em. Yes, he 'll
      fight, an' ef he ever does jine the ranks above he 'll do the work o' ten
      men when thar's blood to spill. I seed 'im in a row once durin' election
      when he was leggin' fer a friend o' his'n; he stood right at the polls an'
      wanted to slug every man that voted agin 'im. He knocked three men's teeth
      down the'r throats an' bunged up two more so that they looked like they
      had on false-faces."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the preacher permitted himself to laugh. Being a fighting man
      himself, his heart warmed towards a man who seemed to be born to that sort
      of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He looks like he could do a sight of it," was his comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture the subject of the conversation came round the house,
      carrying a big piece of bacon wrapped in a tow grain-bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say thar, Pole," Abner called out to the long, lank fellow. "We are
      a-goin' to have preachin' at Rock Crest to-morrow; you'd better have a
      shirt washed an' hung out to dry. They are a-beatin' the bushes fer yore
      sort."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole Baker paused and brushed back his long, thick hair from his heavy
      eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been a-waitin' to see ef meetin' ever'd do you any good, Uncle Ab,"
      he laughed. "They tell me the more you go the wuss you git to be. Neil
      Filmore said t'other day ef you didn't quit shootin' off yore mouth they'd
      give you a trial in meetin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner laughed good-naturedly as he spat over the edge of the veranda floor
      to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's been talked, I know, Pole," he said, "but they don't mean it. They
      all know how to take my fun. But you come on to meetin'; it will do you
      good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, maybe I will," promised Pole, and he came to the steps, and,
      putting his bacon down, he bent towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a powerful hard matter to know exactly what's right an' what's
      wrong, in some things," he said. "Now looky heer." Thrusting his hand down
      into the pocket of his trousers he drew out a piece of quartz-rock with a
      lump of yellow gold about the size of a pea half embedded in it. "That
      thar's puore gold. I got it this away: A feller that used to be my right
      bower in my still business left me when I swore off an' went over to
      Dalonega to work in them mines. T'other day he was back on a visit, an' he
      give me this chunk an' said he'd found it. Now I know in reason that he
      nabbed it while he was at work, but I don't think I'd have a right to
      report it to the minin' company, an' so I'm jest obleeged to receive
      stolen goods. It ain't wuth more'n a dollar, they tell me, an' I 'll hang
      on to it, I reckon, ruther'n have a laborin' man discharged from a job.
      I'm tryin' my level best to live up to the line now, an' I don't know how
      to manage sech a thing as that. I've come to the conclusion that no harm
      will be done nohow, beca'se miners ain't too well paid anyway, an' ef I
      jest keep it an' don't git no good out of it, I won't be in it any more'n
      ef I'd never got hold o' the blamed thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the law, brother Baker," said Dole, solemnly; "without the law we'd
      be an awful lot o' people, an' every man ort to uphold it. Render the
      things that are Caesar's unto Caesar."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole's face was blank for a moment, and Abner came to his rescue with a
      broad smile and sudden laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon you don't remember him, Pole," he said. "He's dead. He was a
      nigger that used to belong to old man Throgmartin in the cove. He used to
      be sech an awful thief during slavery days that it got to be a common
      sayin' that everything lyin' round mought as well be his'n, fer he'd take
      it sooner ur later, anyways."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've heerd o' that nigger," said Pole, much to the preacher's disgust,
      which grew as Pole continued: "Well, they say a feller that knows the law
      is broke an' don't report it is as guilty as the man who does the
      breakin'. Now, Mr. Dole, you know how I come by this nugget, an' ef you
      want to do your full duty you 'll ride over to Dalonega an' report it to
      the right parties. I can't afford the trip."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner laughed out at this, and then forced a serious look on his face.
      "That's what you railly ort to do, brother Dole," he said. "Them Csars
      over thar ud appreciate it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mrs. Bishop came out to shake hands with the preacher, and invited
      him to go to his room to wash his face and hands. As the tall man followed
      his hostess away, Abner winked slyly at Pole and laughed under his long,
      scrawny hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Uncle Ab, you ort to be killed," smiled Pole. "You've been settin' heer
      the last half-hour pokin' fun at that feller, an' you know it. Well, I'm
      goin' on home. Sally's a-goin' to fry some o' this truck fer me, an' I'm
      as hungry as a bear."
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes after he had gone, Dole came out of his room and sat down in
      his chair again. "That seems to be a sorter bright young man," he
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As bright as a new dollar," returned Abner, in a tone of warm admiration.
      "Did you notice that big, wedge-shaped head o' his'n? It's plumb full o'
      brains. One day a feller come down to Filmore's store. He made a business
      o' feelin' o' heads an' writin' out charts at twenty-five cents apiece. He
      didn't waste much time on the rest o' the scabs he examined; but when he
      got to Pole's noggin he talked fer a good hour. I never heerd the like. He
      said ef his talents had been properly directed Pole ud 'a' made a big
      public man. He said he hadn't run across sech a head in a month o'
      Sundays. He was right, you bet, an' every one o' the seven brats Pole's
      got is jest as peert as he is. They are a-growin' up in idleness an' rags,
      too. I wisht I could meet some o' them dum big Yankees that are a-sendin'
      the'r money down heer an' buildin' fine schools to educate niggers an'
      neglectin' the'r own race beca'se it fit agin 'em. You cayn't hardly beat
      larnin' into a nigger's head, an' it ud be only common-sense to spend
      money whar it ud do the most good. I 'ain't got nothin' agin a nigger
      bein' larnt to read an' write, but I cayn't stomach the'r bein' forced
      ahead o' deservin' white folks sooner 'n the Lord counted on. Them kind o'
      Yankees is the same sort that makes pets o' dogs, an' pampers 'em up when
      pore white children is in need of food an' affection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pole looks like he had natural capacity," said Dole. He was fond of
      conversing with Abner on any topic except that of religious matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'd make a bang-up detective," laughed Abner. "One day I was at
      Filmore's store. Neil sometimes, when he's rushed, gits Pole to clerk fer
      'im, beca'se he's quick at figures. It happened that Pole had the store to
      'imse'f one day when Neil had gone off to cut down a bee-tree with a
      passle o' neighbors, an' a triflin' feller come in an' begun to nose
      about. An' when Pole's back was turned to weigh up some cotton in the seed
      he stole a pocket-book out o' the show-case. I reckon Pole didn't like his
      looks much nohow, fer as soon as the skunk had gone he begun to look about
      to see ef he'd tuck anything. All at once he missed the pocket-book, an'
      told Neil that night that he was mighty nigh shore the feller lifted it,
      but he couldn't railly swear to it. About a week after that he seed the
      same feller comin' down the road headed fer the store on his gray mule. Me
      'n' Neil was both thar an' Pole hustled us in the back room, an' told us
      to stay thar. He said he was a-goin' to find out ef the feller stold the
      book. Neil was afeerd of a row an' tried to prevent 'im, but he jest
      shoved us back an' shet the door on us. Neil got 'im a crack in the
      partition an' I found me a knothole.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The feller hitched an' come in an' said howdy-do, an' started to take a
      cheer nigh the door, but Pole stopped 'im.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Come heer to the show-case,' ses he; 'I want to show you some 'n'.'The
      feller went, an' I seed Pole yank out the box 'at had the rest o' the
      pocket-books in it. 'Look y'heer,' Pole said, in a loud, steady voice&mdash;you
      could 'a' heerd 'im clean to the creek&mdash;'look y'heer. The regular
      price o' these books is fifty cents; that's what we sell 'em fer; but
      you've got to run yore hand down in yore pocket an' give me a dollar fer
      one quicker'n you ever made a trade in yore life.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What in the hell do you mean?' the feller said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I mean exactly what I said, an' you are a-losin' time.' said Pole,
      talkin' louder an' louder. 'The price is fifty cents; but you got to gi'me
      a dollar fer one. Haul 'er out, my friend; haul 'er out! It 'll be the
      cheapest thing you ever bought in yore life.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The feller was as white as a sheet. He gulped two or three times 'fore he
      spoke, then he said: 'I know what you think; you think I took one t'other
      day when I was lookin' in the show-case; but you are mistaken.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I never said a word about you takin' one,' Pole yelled at 'im, 'but
      you'd better yank out that dollar an' buy one; you need it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The feller did it. I heerd the money clink as he laid it on the glass an'
      I knowed he was convicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'They are only wuth fifty cents,' he said, kinder faint-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yo're a liar,' Pole yelled at 'im, 'fer you've jest paid a dollar fer
      one on yore own accord. Now I 'll jest give you two minutes to straddle
      that mule. Ef you don't I 'll take you to the sheriff myself, you damned
      thief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I've always done my tradin' heer,' said the feller, thinkin' that ud
      sorter pacify Pole, but he said: 'Yes, an' yore stealin', too, I reckon,
      you black-livered jailbird. Git out, git out!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me 'n' Neil come in when the feller'd gone, but Pole was actually too mad
      to speak. 'He got off too durned light,'he said, after a while. 'I could
      'a' sold 'im a big bill o' goods at a hundred per cent, profit, fer he had
      plenty o' money. Now he's ridin' off laughin' at me.'"

      EIL FILMORE'S store was about half a mile from Bishop's house, at the
      crossing of the Darley road and another leading into East Tennessee. Alan
      had gone down there one day to engage white labor to work in his growing
      cotton, negroes being scarce, owing to the tendency of that race to flock
      into the towns. With the aid of Pole Baker, who was clerking that day for
      Filmore, he soon employed the men he wanted and started to walk back home.
      On the way he was overtaken by his uncle, who was returning from Darley in
      his wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold on thar," the old man called out; "ef you are a-goin' home I 'll
      rest yore legs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan smiled as he climbed up into the seat by the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall certainly appreciate it," he said. "I'm tired out to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sorter thought you looked flabbergasted," returned Abner, as he swung
      his whip over the backs of his sleek horses. "Well, I reckon I could
      afford to give you a ride. I hauled that cuss Dole three miles goin'
      t'other way. He had the cheek to yell at me from Habbersham's gin-house
      an' axed me ef I'd haul 'im. Then he kept me waitin' till he'd helt prayer
      an' read to the family."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't seem to like him," said Alan. "I've noticed that for some
      time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon I don't to any great extent," said Abner, clucking to his tired
      horses; "but it ain't raily to my credit. A feller's wrong som 'er's,
      Alan, that allows hisse'f to hate anything the Lord ever made. I've
      struggled agin that proposition fer twenty-five yeer. All this talk about
      the devil makin' the bad an' the Lord the good is talk through a hat. Bad
      things was made 'fore the devil ever jumped from his high estate ur he'd
      never preferred a fork to a harp. I've tuck notice, too, that the wust
      things I ever seed was sometimes at the root o' the best. Manure is a bad
      thing, but a cake of it will produce a daisy bigger 'n any in the field.
      Dole makes me gag sometimes; but as narrer as he is twixt the eyes, he may
      do some good. I reckon that hell-fire sermon he give us last August made
      some of the crowd sweat out a little o' the'r meanness. I'd 'a' been more
      merciful on sech a hot day, though. He mought 'a' reserved that harangue
      fer some cold day in December when the stove-flues wouldn't work. Ef I'd
      'a' been a-goin' tell about future torment that hot day I'd 'a' said that
      every lost soul was made to set on a cake o' ice in a windy spot through
      all eternity, an' I'd 'a' started out by singin' 'On Greenland's Icy
      Mountain.' But that ain't what I axed you to git in my wagon fer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't intend to try to convert me, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I didn't, fer you are jest my sort of a Christian&mdash;better'n me,
      a sight, fer you don't shoot off yore bazoo on one side or t'other, an'
      that's the habit I'm tryin' to quit. Ef I could hold in when Dole gits to
      spoutin' I'd be a better man. I think I 'll do better now. I've got a
      tenpenny nail in my pocket an' whenever he starts in I'm goin' to bite it
      an' keep my holt on it till he stops. Yes, you are jest my sort of a
      Christian. You believe in breathin' fresh air into yore windpipe, thankin'
      God with a clear eye an' a good muscle, an' takin' what He gives you an'
      axin' 'Im to pass more ef it's handy. You know the Lord has sent you a
      invite to His table, an' you believe in eatin' an' drinkin' an' makin'
      merry, jest like you'd have a body do that was stoppin' over night with
      you. Yes, I wanted to say some 'n' else to you. As I got to the widder
      Snowden's house, a mile this side o' Darley, she came out an' axed me ef
      I'd object to deliverin' a couple o' smoke-cured hams to a feller in town
      that had ordered 'em. Of course that's what a' old bach' like me 's heer
      fer, so I let 'er fling 'em in the back end."
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker paused and smiled knowingly, and Alan noticed that he slowed
      his horses up by drawing firmly on the reins as if he feared that their
      arrival at the farm-house might interrupt what he had to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Alan, "you delivered the hams?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes." Abner was looking straight ahead of him. "They was fer Colonel Seth
      Barclay. I driv' up to the side gate, after I'd helloed in front till I
      was hoarse, an' who do you reckon come trippin' out o' the dinin'-room?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was <i>her</i>. Ef you hain't never ketched 'er off'n her guard round
      the house, you've missed a treat. Durned ef I don't like 'er better
      without a hat on than with all the fluffy flamdoodle that gals put on when
      they go out. She was as neat as a new pin, an' seemed powerful glad to see
      me. That made me bless the widder Snowden fer sendin' me thar. She said
      the cook was off som 'er's, an' that old nigger Ned, the stable-man, was
      in the garden-patch behind the house, so she was thar by 'erse'f. She
      actually looked like she wanted to tote in the hams 'erse'f ruther'n
      bother me; but you bet my old bones hopped off'n this seat quicker'n you
      could say Jack Robinson with yore mouth open. I was afeerd my team
      wouldn't stand, fer fellers was a-scootin' by on bicycles; but I tuck the
      hams to the back porch an' put 'em on a shelf out'n re'ch o' the dogs.
      Then I went back to my wagon. She follered me to the fence, an' I noticed
      that some 'n' was wrong with 'er. She looked so funny, an' droopy about
      the mouth, an' kept a-talkin' like she was afeerd I'd fly off. She axed
      all about Adele an' how she was a-makin' out down in Atlanta, an' said
      she'd heerd that Sis was mighty popular with the young men, an' from that
      she axed about my craps an' the meetin' goin' on at Big Bethel. Finally
      she got right white about the mouth, an' said, kinder shaky, that she was
      afeerd you was mad about some 'n' her pa'd said about you, an' I never
      seed a woman as nigh cryin' as she was without doin' of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told 'er I was at the fust of it; but I'd noticed how worried you've
      looked heer of late, an' so I told 'er I'd been afeerd some 'n' had come
      betwixt you two. Then she put her head down on the top rail o' the fence
      an' helt it thar fer a good minute. After a while she looked up an' told
      me all about it an' ended by axin' me ef I thought she was to blame in the
      matter. I told 'er no; but her old skunk of a daddy had acted sech a fool
      that I couldn't hold in. I reckon I told 'er jest about what I thought o'
      him an' the more I raked up agin 'im the better she seemed pleased. I
      tried to pin' er down to what she'd be willin' to do in a pinch ef her pa
      continued to hold out agin you, but she was too sharp to commit 'erse'f.
      It jest looked like she wanted to make up with you an' didn't want no row
      nuther."
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses stopped to drink at a clear stream of water which ran across
      the road on a bed of brown pebbles. The bridles were too tight to allow
      them to lower their heads, so Alan went out on the heavy tongue between
      the pair and unfastened the reins. When he had regained his seat he told
      the old man in detail all that had happened at the dance at the hotel,
      ending with the advice he had received from Rayburn Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know about that," Abner said. "Maybe Miller could call a halt
      like that an' go on like nothin' had happened. I don't say he could nur
      couldn't; but it's fool advice. You mought miss it, an' regret it to yore
      dyin' day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan looked at him in some surprise; he had hardly expected just that
      stand on the part of a confirmed old bachelor like his uncle. The old
      man's glance swept dreamily over the green fields on either side of the
      road across which the red rays of the setting sun were streaming. Then he
      took a deep breath and lowered the reins till they rested on the backs of
      the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My boy," he began, "I'm a good mind to tell you some 'n' that I hain't
      mentioned fer mighty nigh forty yeer. I don't believe anything but my
      intrust in that town gal an' you would make me bring it up. Huh! Ray
      Miller says you kin pass 'er over jest as ef you'd never seed 'er, does
      he? An' go on an' pick an' choose agin. Huh! I wasn't as old as you are by
      five yeer when the one I'm talkin' about passed away, jest a week after me
      'n' her 'd come to a understandin'. I've seed women, women, women, sence I
      seed 'er corpse that day amongst all that pile o' wild flowers that old
      an' young fetched from the woods whar me 'n' 'er used to walk, but ef I
      live to be as old as that thar hill I 'll never forget my feelin'. I kin
      see 'er right now as plain as I did then, an' sometimes my heart aches as
      bad. I reckon you know now why I never got married. Folks has poked a lots
      o' fun at me, an' I tuck it as it was intended, but a lots o' times what
      they said made me suffer simply awful. They've picked out this un an' that
      un, from spring chickins to hags o' all ages, shapes, an' sizes; but the
      very thought o' givin' anybody her place made me sick. Thar never was but
      one fer me. I may be a fool, but I believe I was intended fer her. Shucks!
      Sech skip-abouts as Miller may talk sech bosh as that, but it's because
      the Lord never give 'em the glory o' the other thing. It larnt me the
      truth about the after-life; I know thar's a time to come, an' a blessed
      one, ur the Lord never would 'a' give me that taste of it. She's som 'er's
      out o' harm's way, an' when me 'n' her meet I 'll not have a wrinkle, an'
      I 'll be able to walk as spry an' hopeful as I did when she was heer. Thar
      ort to be punishment reserved fer hard-headed fools that separate lovin'
      young folks beca'se one ur t'other hain't jest so many dollars tied in a
      rag. Don't you listen to Miller. I don't say you ort to plunge right in
      an' make the old man mad; but don't give up. Ef she's what I think she is,
      an' she sees you ain't a-goin' to run after no fresh face, she 'll stick
      to you like the bark on a tree. The wait won't hurt nuther one of you,
      either. My wait ain't a-hurtin' me, an' yore'n won't you. I never seed a
      young woman I liked better 'n I do the one you selected, an' I've sent up
      many a petition that you'd both make it all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man raised his reins and clucked to his horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Uncle Ab," said Alan, "you've made a better man of me. I've had a lot of
      trouble over this, but you make me hope. I've tried to give her up, but I
      simply cannot do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She ain't a-goin' to give you up, nuther," replied Abner; "that's the
      purty part about it. Thar ain't no give up in 'er. She ain't that sort.
      She's goin' to give that daddy o' her'n a tussle."

    <p>
      NE morning early in July, as Alan was passing Pole Baker's cabin, on his
      way to Darley, Pole's wife came out to the fence and stopped him. She was
      a slender, ill-clad woman, who had once been pretty, and her face still
      had a sort of wistful attractiveness that was appealing to one who knew
      what she had been through since her marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you goin' to town, Mr. Alan?" she asked, nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Mrs. Baker," Alan answered. "Is there anything I can do for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply at once, but came through the little gate, which swung
      on wooden hinges, and stood looking up at him, a thin, hesitating hand on
      his bridle-rein.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afeerd some 'n' s happened to Pole," she faltered. "He hain't been
      home fer two whole days an' nights. It's about time fer 'im to spree agin,
      an' I'm powerful afeerd he's in trouble. I 'lowed while you was in town
      that you mought inquire about 'im, an' let me know when you come back.
      That ud sorter free my mind a little. I didn't close my eyes all last
      night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll do all I can, Mrs. Baker," Alan promised. "But you mustn't worry;
      Pole can take care of himself, drunk or sober. I 'll be back to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan rode on, leaving the pathetic figure at the gate looking after him.
      "I wonder," he mused, "what Uncle Ab would say about love that has that
      sort of reward. Poor woman! Pole was her choice, and she has to make the
      best of it. Perhaps she loves the good that's in the rascal."
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Rayburn Miller at his desk, making out some legal document. "Take
      a seat," said Miller, "I 'll be through in a minute. What's the news out
      your way?" he asked, as he finished his work and put down his pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing new, I believe," said Alan. "I've been away for two days. Not
      having anything else to do, I made it my business to ride over every foot
      of my father's big investment, and, to tell you the truth, I've come to
      you with a huge idea. Don't laugh; I can't help it. It popped in my head
      and sticks, that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. Let me have it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before I tell you what it is," said Alan, "I want you to promise not to
      ridicule me. I'm as green as a gourd in business matters; but the idea has
      hold of me, and I don't know that even your disapproval will make me let
      it loose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a good way to put it," laughed Miller. "The idea has hold of you
      and you can't let it loose. It applies more closely to investments than
      anything else. Once git into a deal and you are afraid to let it go&mdash;like
      the chap that held the calf and called for help."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, here it is," said Alan. "I've made up my mind that a railroad can&mdash;and
      shall&mdash;be built from these two main lines to my father's lumber
      bonanza." Miller whistled. A broad smile ingulfed the pucker of his lips,
      and then his face dropped into seriousness. A look almost of pity for his
      friend's credulity and inexperience came into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must say you don't want a little thing, my boy," he said, indulgently.
      "Remember you are talking to a fellow that has rubbed up against the
      moneyed world considerable for a chap raised in the country. The trouble
      with you, Alan, is that you have got heredity to contend with; you are a
      chip off the old block in spite of your belonging to a later generation.
      You have inherited your father's big ideas. You are a sort of Colonel
      Sellers, who sees millions in everything you look at."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan' s face fell, but there remained in it a tenacious expression that
      won Miller's admiration even while he deplored it. There was, too, a ring
      of confidence in the young farmer's tone when he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much would a railroad through that country, eighteen miles in length,
      cost?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing but a survey by an expert could answer that, even approximately,"
      said the lawyer, leaning back in his creaking chair. "If you had the right
      of way, a charter from the State, and no big tunnels to make nor long
      bridges to build, you might, I should say, construct the road alone&mdash;without
      locomotives and rolling-stock generally&mdash;for a little matter of one
      hundred and fifty thousand. I don't know; I'm only guessing; but it
      wouldn't fall under that estimate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't think it would," replied Alan, growing more enthusiastic. "Now
      then, if there <i>was</i> a railroad to my father's property, how much
      would his twenty thousand acres be worth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller smiled again and began to figure on a scrap of paper with a pencil.
      "Oh, as for that," he said, "it would really be worth&mdash;standing
      uncut, unsawn, including a world of tan-bark&mdash;at least twenty-five
      dollars an acre, say a clear half million for it all. Oh, I know it looks
      as plain as your nose on your face; things always do on paper. It looks
      big and it shines; so does a spider-web in the sunshine to a fly; but you
      don't want to be no fly, my boy; and you don't want any spider-webs&mdash;on
      the brain, anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan stood up and walked to the door and back; finally he shrugged his
      broad shoulders. "I don't care what you say," he declared, bringing his
      hand down firmly on Miller's desk. "It will pay, as sure as I'm alive.
      There's no getting around the facts. It will take a quarter of a million
      investment to market a half-million-dollar bunch of timber with the land
      thrown in and the traffic such a road would secure to help pay expenses.
      There are men in the world looking for such opportunities and I'm going to
      give somebody a chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have not looked deep enough into it, my boy," mildly protested
      Miller. "You haven't figured on the enormous expense of running such a
      road and the dead loss of the investment after the lumber is moved out.
      You'd have a railroad property worth a quarter of a million on your hands.
      I can't make you see my position. I simply say to you that I wouldn't
      touch a deal like that with a ten-foot pole."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan laughed good-naturedly as he laid his hand on his friend's shoulder.
      "I reckon you think I'm off," he said, "but sooner or later I'm going to
      put this thing through. Do you hear me? I 'll put it through if it takes
      ten years to do it. I want to make the old man feel that he has not made
      such a fool of himself; I want to get even with the Thompson crowd, and
      Perkins, and everybody that is now poking fun at a helpless old man. I
      shall begin by raising money some way or other to pay taxes, and hold on
      to every inch of the ground."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller's glance fell before the fierce fire of Alan's eyes, and for the
      first time his tone wavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, "you may have the stuff in you that big speculators are
      made of, and I may simply be prejudiced against the scheme on account of
      your father's blind plunging, and what some men would call
      over-cautiousness on my part. I may be trying to prevent what you really
      ought to do; but I am advising you as a friend. I only know <i>I</i> would
      be more cautious. Of course, you may try. You'd not lose in doing that; in
      fact, you'd gain experience. I should say that big dealers in lumber are
      the men you ought to see first. They know the values of such investments,
      and they are reaching out in all directions now. They have cleaned up the
      timber near the railroads."

      ILLER accompanied Alan to the door. Old Trabue stood in front of his
      office in his shirt-sleeves, his battered silk hat on the back part of his
      head. He was fanning himself with a palm-leaf fan and freely using his
      handkerchief on his brow. He bowed cordially to Alan and came towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to ask you," he began, "as Pole Baker any way of raisin' money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that I know of," laughed Alan. "I don't know whether he's got a clear
      title to the shirt on his back. He owes everybody out our way. My father
      is supplying him on time now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was my impression," said Trabue. "He wanted me to defend 'im the
      other day, but he couldn't satisfy me about the fee, an' I let him go. He
      first said he could give me a lien on a mule, but he finally admitted that
      it wasn't his."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's not in trouble, is he?" exclaimed Alan, suddenly recalling Mrs.
      Baker's uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trabue looked at Miller, who stood leaning in the doorway, and laughed.
      "Well, I reckon he might call it that. That chap owned the town two days
      ago. He got blind, stavin' drunk, an' wanted to whip us from one end o'
      the place to the other. The marshals are afraid of 'im, for they know he
      'll shoot at the drop of a hat, an' the butt of it was stickin' out o' his
      hippocket in plain sight. Was you thar, Rayburn? Well, it was better 'n a
      circus. Day before yesterday thar was a sort o' street temperance lecturer
      in front o' the Johnston House, speakin' on a dry-goods box. He had a lot
      o' gaudy pictures illustratin' the appearance of a drinkin' man' s stomach
      an' liver, compared to one in a healthy condition. He was a sort of a
      snide faker, out fer what he could git dropped in a hat, an' Pole was
      sober enough to git on to his game. Pole stood thar with the rest, jest
      about able to stand, an' that was all. Finally, when the feller got warmed
      up an' got to screechin', Pole begun to deny what he was sayin'. As fast
      as he'd make a statement Pole would flatly deny it. The feller on the box
      didn't know what a tough customer he had to handle or he'd 'a' gone slow.
      As it was, he p'inted a finger o' scorn at Pole an' helt 'im up fer a
      example. Pole wasn't sober by a long shot, but you'd 'a' thought he was,
      fer he was as steady as a post. He kept grinnin', as cool as a cucumber,
      an' sayin', 'Now you know yo' re a-lyin', stranger&mdash;jest a-lyin' to
      get a few dimes drapped in yore hat. You know nobody's stomach don't look
      like that durn chromo. You never seed inside of a drinkin' man, an' yo' re
      the biggest liar that ever walked the earth.' This made the crowd laugh at
      the little, dried-up feller, an' he got as mad as Old Nick. He begun to
      tell Pole his liver was swelled from too much whiskey, an' that he'd bet
      he was jest the sort to beat his wife. Most of us thought that ud make
      Pole jump on 'im, but he seemed to enjoy naggin' the feller too much to
      sp'ile it by a fight. A nigger boy had been carryin' round a bell and a
      sign advertisin' Webb's auction sale, an' stopped to see the fun. Pole
      heerd the tinkle of the bell, an' tuck it an' begun to ring it in the
      lecturer's face. The harder the feller spoke the harder Pole rung. It was
      the damnedest racket ever heerd on a public square. Part of the crowd&mdash;the
      good church folks&mdash;begun to say it was a disgrace to the town to
      allow a stranger to be treated that away, sence thar was no law agin
      public speakin' in the streets. They was in fer callin' a halt, but all
      the rest&mdash;the drinkin' men, an' I frankly state I was one&mdash;secretly
      hoped Pole would ring 'im down. When the pore devil finally won I felt
      like yellin' hooray, fer I glory in the pluck even of a dare-devil, if
      he's a North Georgian an' white. The lecturer had to stop without his
      collection, an' went off to the council chamber swearin' agin the town fer
      allowin' him to be treated that away. Thar wasn't anything fer the mayor
      to do but order Pole's arrest, but it took four men&mdash;two regulars and
      two deputized men&mdash;to accomplish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The trial was the richest thing I ever attended. Pole had sobered up jest
      enough to be witty, an' he had no more respect fer Bill Barrett's court
      than he had fer the lecturer's platform. Him an' Barrett used to fish an'
      hunt together when they was boys, an' Pole kept callin' him Bill. It was
      Bill this an' Bill that; an' as Barrett had only been in office a month,
      he hardly knew how to rise to his proper dignity, especially when he saw
      the crowd was laughin' at his predicament. When I declined to defend 'im,
      Pole attempted to read the law on the case to Barrett an' show whar he was
      right. Barrett let 'im talk because he didn't know how to stop 'im, an'
      Pole made the best defence I ever heerd from a unlettered man. It kept the
      crowd in a roar. For a while I swear it looked like Pole was goin' to
      cleer hisse'f, but Barrett had to do his duty, an' so he fined Pole thirty
      dollars, or in default thereof to break rock on the streets fer ten days.
      You ort to 'a' heerd Pole snort. 'Looky heer, Bill!' he said, 'you know as
      well as yo're a-settin' cocked up thar, makin' folks say 'yore honor'
      ever' breath they draw, that I ain't a-goin' to break no rock in that
      br'ilin' sun fer ten day 'ca'se I beat that skunk at his own game!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "You 'll have to do it if you don't pay out," Barrett told 'im.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, I jest won't pay out, an' I won't break rock nuther,' Pole said.
      'You've heerd about the feller that could lead a hoss to water but
      couldn't make 'im drink, hain't you? Well, I'm the hoss.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yesterday was Pole's fust day on the street. They put a ball an' chain to
      one of his ankles an' sent 'im out with the nigger gang, but all day
      yesterday an' to-day he hain't worked a lick. He's as stubborn as a mule.
      Thar's been a crowd around 'im all the time. You kin see 'im standin' up
      as straight as a post in the middle of the street from one end of it to
      the other. I'm sorter sorry fer 'im; he looks like he's ashamed at bottom,
      but don't want to give in. The funniest thing about the whole thing is
      that Pole seems to know more about the law than the mayor. He says unless
      they force him to work in the specified ten days they can't hold him any
      longer, an' that if they attempt to flog 'im he 'll kill the first man
      that lays hands on him. I think Bill Barrett likes him too well to have
      'im whipped, an' the whole town is guyin' him, an' axin' 'im why he don't
      make Pole set in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan went down the street to see Pole. He found him seated on a large
      stone, a long-handled rock-hammer at his feet. He looked up from under his
      broad-brimmed hat, and a crestfallen look came into his big, brown eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry to see this, Pole," said Alan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole stood up at his full height, the chain clanking as he rose. "They
      hain't treated me right about this matter, Alan Bishop," he said, half
      resentfully, half as if he recognized his own error. "Bill knows he hain't
      done the fair thing. I know I was full, but I jest wanted to have my fun.
      That don't justify him in puttin' me out heer with these niggers fer folks
      to gap' at, an' he knows it. He ain't a friend right. Me 'n' him has slep'
      together on the same pile o' leaves, an' I've let 'im pull down on a
      squirrel when I could 'a' knocket it from its perch; an' I've lent 'im my
      pointer an' gun many an' many a time. But he's showed what he is! He's got
      the wrong sow by the yeer, though, fer ef he keeps me heer till Christmas
      I 'll never crack a rock, unless I do it by accidentally step-pin' on it.
      Mark my words, Alan Bishop, thar 'll be trouble out o' this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't talk that way, Pole," said Alan. "You've broken the law and they
      had to punish you for it. If they hadn't they would have made themselves
      ridiculous. Why didn't you send me word you were in trouble, Pole?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellow hung his head, and then he blurted out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beca'se I knowed you would make a fool o' yorese'f an' try to pay me out.
      Damn it, Alan Bishop, this ain't no business o' yore'n!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll make it my business," said Alan. "How much is your fine? You ought
      to have sent me word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sent you hell, Alan Bishop," growled the prisoner. "When I send you word
      to he'p me out of a scrape that whiskey got me into I 'll do it after I've
      decently cut my throat. I <i>say!</i>&mdash;when you've plead with me like
      you have to quit the durn stuff!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point of the conversation Jeff Dukes, a man of medium size,
      dressed in dark-blue uniform, with a nickel-plated badge shaped like a
      shield and bearing the words "Marshal No. 2," came directly towards them
      from a stone-cutter's shop near by.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look heer, Bishop," he said, dictatorially, "whar'd you git the right to
      talk to that man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan looked surprised. "Am I breaking the law, too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are, ef you hain't got a permit from the mayor in yore pocket."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I have no permit," replied Alan, with a good-natured smile. "Have
      you got another ball an' chain handy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer frowned off his inclination to treat the matter as a jest.
      "You ort to have more sense than that," he said, crustily. "Pole's put out
      heer to work his time out, an' ef everybody in town is allowed to laugh
      an' joke with him he'd crack about as many rocks as you or me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a durn liar, Jeff Dukes," said Pole, angrily. "You are a-makin'
      that up to humiliate me furder. You know no law like that never was
      inforced. Ef I ever git you out in Pea Vine Destrict I 'll knock a dent in
      that egg-shaped head o' yor'n, an' make them eyes look two ways fer
      Sunday. You know a gentleman like Alan Bishop wouldn't notice you under
      ordinary circumstances, an' so you trump up that excuse to git his
      attention."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men glared at each other, but Pole seemed to get the best of that
      sort of combat, for the officer only growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can insult a man when you are under arrest," he said, "beca'se you
      know I am under bond to keep the peace. But I'm not afeerd of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They tell me you are afeerd o' sperits, though," retorted the prisoner.
      "They tell me a little nigger boy that was shot when a passle o' skunks
      went to whip his daddy fer vagrancy stands at the foot o' yore bed ever'
      night. Oh, I know what I'm a-talkin' about!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you know a lots," said the man, sullenly, as his eyes fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      To avoid encouraging the disputants further, Alan walked suddenly away.
      The marshal took willing advantage of the opportunity and followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could make a case agin you," he said, catching up, "but I know you
      didn't mean to violate the ordinance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, of course I didn't," said Alan; "but I want to know if that fellow
      could be released if I paid his fine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not fool enough to do it, are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you got the money in yore pocket?" The officer was laughing, as if
      at a good joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well"&mdash;the marshal laughed again as he swung his short club round by
      a string that fastened it to his wrist&mdash;"well, you come with me, an'
      I 'll show you a man that wants thirty dollars wuss than any man I know
      of. I don't believe Bill Barrett has slept a wink sence this thing
      happened. He 'll be tickled to death to git off so easy. The town has
      devilled the life out of him. He don't go by whar Pole's at work&mdash;I
      mean, whar he ain't at work&mdash;fer Pole yells at 'im whenever he sees
      'im."
    </p>
    <p>
      That night when Alan reached home he sent a servant over to tell Mrs.
      Baker that Pole was all right and that he'd be home soon. He had eaten his
      supper and had gone up-stairs to go to bed when he heard his name called
      outside. Going to a window and looking out, he recognized Pole Baker
      standing at the gate in the clear moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alan," he said, softly, "come down heer a minute. I want to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan went down and joined him. For a moment Pole stood leaning against the
      fence, his eyes hidden by his broad-brimmed slouch hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you want to see me, Pole?" Alan asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I did," the fellow swallowed. He made a motion as if to reach out
      his hand, but refrained. Then he looked straight into Alan's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't go to sleep till I'd said some 'n' to you," he began, with
      another gulp. "I laid down an' made a try at it, but it wasn't no go. I've
      got to say it. I'm heer to swear that ef God, or some 'n' else, don't show
      me a way to pay you back fer what you done to-day, I 'll never draw a
      satisfied breath. Alan Bishop, yo're a man, <i>God damn it!</i> a man from
      yore outside skin to the marrow o' yore bones, an' ef I don't find some
      way to prove what I think about you, I 'll jest burn up! I got into that
      trouble as thoughtless as I'd play a prank with my baby, an' then they all
      come down on me an' begun to try to drive me like a hog out'n a field with
      rocks an' sticks, an' the very Old Harry riz in me an' defied 'em. I
      reckon thar wasn't anything Bill could do but carry out the law, an' I
      knowed it, but I wasn't ready to admit it. Then you come along an'
      rendered a verdict in my favor when you needed the money you did it with.
      Alan, ef I don't show my appreciation, it 'll be beca'se I don't live long
      enough. You never axed me but one thing, an' that was to quit drinkin'
      whiskey. I'm goin' to make a try at it, not beca'se I think that 'll pay
      you back, but beca'se with a sober head I kin be a better friend to you ef
      the chance ever comes my way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad to hear you say that, Pole," replied Alan, greatly moved by the
      fellow's earnestness. "I believe you can do it. Then your wife and
      children&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn my wife an' children," snorted Pole. "It's <i>you</i> I'm a-goin' to
      work fer&mdash;<i>you</i>, I say!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly turned through the open gate and strode homeward across the
      fields. Alan stood looking after him till his tall form was lost in the
      hazy moonlight, and then he went up to his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole entered the open door of his cabin and began to undress as he sat on
      the side of his crude bedstead, made of unbarked poles fastened to the
      bare logs in one corner of the room. His wife and children slept on two
      beds on the other side of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you see 'im, Pole?" piped up Mrs. Baker from the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I seed 'im. Sally, say, whar's that bottle o' whiskey I had the last
      time I was at home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an ominous silence. Out of it rose the soft breathing of the
      children. Then the woman sighed. "Pole, shorely you ain't a-goin' to begin
      agin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I want to bu'st it into smithereens. I don't want it about&mdash;I
      don't want to know thar's a drap in the house. I've swore off, an' this
      time she sticks. Gi'me that bottle."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another silence. Suddenly the woman spoke. "Pole, you've swore off as many
      times as a dog has fleas. Often when I feel bad an' sick when you are off,
      a drap o' whiskey makes me feel better. I don't want you to destroy the
      last bit in the house jest be-ca'se you've tuck this turn, that may wear
      off before daylight. The last time you emptied that keg on the ground an'
      swore off you got on a spree an' helt the baby over the well an'
      threatened to drap 'er in ef I didn't find a bottle, an' you'd 'a' done
      it, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole laughed softly. "I reckon yo' re right, old gal," he said. "Besides,
      ef I can' t&mdash;ef I ain't man enough to let up with a bottle in the
      house I won't do it without. But the sight or smell of it is hell itse'f
      to a lover of the truck. Ef I was to tell you what a little thing started
      me on this last spree you'd laugh. I went to git a shave in a barber shop,
      an' when the barber finished he soaked my face in bay-rum an' it got in my
      mustache. I kept smellin' it all mornin' an' tried to wipe it off, but she
      wouldn't wipe. All the time I kept walkin' up an' down in front o' Luke
      Sell-more's bar. Finally I said to myself: 'Well, ef you have to have a
      bar-room stuck under yore nose all day like a wet sponge, old man, you
      mought as well have one whar it 'll taste better, an' I slid up to the
      counter." The woman sighed audibly, but she made no reply. "Is Billy
      awake?" Pole suddenly asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you know he ain't," said Mrs. Baker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I want to take 'im in my bed." Pole stood out on the floor in the
      sheet of moonlight that fell through the open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't, Pole," said the woman. "The pore little feller's been
      toddlin' about after the others, draggin' bresh to the heap tell he's
      tired. He drapped to sleep at the table with a piece o' bread in his
      mouth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't wake 'im, God bless his little heart," answered Pole, and he
      reached down and took the limp child in his arms and pressed him against
      the side of his face. He carried him tenderly across the room and laid
      down with him. His wife heard him uttering endearing things to the
      unconscious child until she fell asleep.

    <p>
      T was the second Sunday in July, and a bright, clear day. In that
      mountainous region the early mornings of dry summer days are delightfully
      cool and balmy. Abner Daniel was in his room making preparations to go to
      meeting at Rock Crest Church. He had put on one of his best white shirts,
      black silk necktie, doeskin trousers, flowered waistcoat, and long
      frock-coat, and was proceeding to black his shoes. Into an old pie-pan he
      raked from the back of the fireplace a quantity of soot and added to it a
      little water and a spoonful of sorghum molasses from a jug under his bed,
      stirring the mixture into a paste. This he applied to his shoes with a
      blacking-brush, rubbing vigorously until quite a decent gloss appeared. It
      was a thing poverty had taught him just after the war, and to which he
      still resorted when he forgot to buy blacking.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way to church, as he was crossing a broom-sedge field and steering
      for the wood ahead of him, through which a path made a short cut to Rock
      Crest Church, he overtook Pole Baker swinging along in his shirt-sleeves
      and big hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I 'll be bungfuzzled," Abner exclaimed, "ef you hain't got on a
      clean shirt! Church?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I 'lowed I would, Uncle Ab. I couldn't stay away. I told Sally it ud
      be the biggest fun on earth. She's a-comin' on as soon as she gits the
      childern ready. She's excited, too, an' wants to see how it 'll come out.
      She's as big a believer in you as I am, mighty nigh, an' she 'lowed, she
      did, that she'd bet you'd take hair an' hide off'n that gang 'fore they
      got good started."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner raised his shaggy eyebrows. If this was one of Pole's jokes it
      failed in the directness that usually characterized the jests of the
      ex-moonshiner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder what yo' re a-drivin' at, you blamed fool," he said, smiling in
      a puzzled fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole was walking in front, and suddenly wheeled about. He took off his
      hat, and, wiping the perspiration from his high brow with his forefinger,
      he cracked it into the broom-sedge like a whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Looky' heer, Uncle Ab," he laughed, "what you givin' me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was jest tryin' to find out what you was a-givin' me," retorted the
      rural philosopher, a dry note of rising curiosity dominating his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had reached a rail fence which separated the field from the wood, and
      they climbed over it and stood in the shade of the trees. Pole stared at
      the old man incredulously. "By hunkley, Uncle Ab, you don't mean to tell
      me you don't know what that passle o' hill-Billies is a-goin' to do with
      you this mornin' at meetin'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner smiled mechanically. "I can't say I do, Pole. I'm at the fust of it,
      if thar is to be any&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole slapped his thigh and gave vent to a loud guffaw that rang through
      the trees and was echoed back from a hidden hill-side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what they <i>are</i> a-goin' to do with you 'll be a God's plenty.
      They are a-goin' to walk yore log, ur make you do it on all fours so they
      kin see you. You've made it hot fer them an' they are a-goin' to turn
      t'other cheek an' git a swipe at you. They are a-goin' to show you whar
      you come in&mdash;ur, ruther, whar you go out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner's face was a study in seriousness. "You don't say!" he muttered. "I
      <i>did</i> notice that brother Dole kinder give our house a wide berth
      last night. I reckon he sorter hated to eat at the same table with a
      feller he was goin' to hit at to-day. Yes, Dole is at the bottom of it. I
      know in reason I pushed 'im too fur the last time he was heer, but when he
      rears back an' coughs up sanctimony like he was literally too full of it
      fer comfort, I jest cayn't hold in. Seems to me I kin jest close my eyes
      an' hit some spot in 'im that makes 'im wiggle like a tadpole skeered in
      shallow water. But maybe I mought 'a' got a better mark to fire at; fer
      this 'll raise no end of a rumpus, an' they may try to make me take back
      water, but I never did crawfish. I couldn't do that, Pole. No siree, I&mdash;I
      can' t crawfish."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner was a special object of regard as he and Pole emerged from the wood
      into the opening in front of the little unpainted meeting-house, where the
      men stood about among the buggies and horses, whittling, gossiping, and
      looking strange and fresh-washed in their clean clothes. But it was
      noticeable that they did not gather around him as had been their habit.
      His standing in that religious community was at stake; his continued
      popularity depended on the result of that day's investigation. Pole could
      afford to stand by him, and he did. They sat down on a log near the church
      door and remained silent till the cast-iron bell in the little belfry,
      which resembled a dog-kennel, was rattled vigorously as an announcement
      that the service was about to begin. They all scurried in like sheep.
      Abner went in last, with slow dignity and deliberation, leaving Pole in a
      seat near the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went up the narrow aisle to his accustomed seat near the long-wood
      stove. Many eyes were on his profile and the back of his neck. Dole was
      seated in the arm-chair behind the preacher's stand, but somehow he failed
      to look at Abner as he entered, or even after he had taken his seat. He
      seemed busy making notes from the big Bible which lay across his lap.
      Abner saw Bishop and his wife come in and sit down, and knew from the
      glances they gave him that they had heard the news. Mrs. Bishop looked
      keenly distressed, but Bishop seemed to regard the matter only as a small,
      buzzing incident in his own troubled career. Besides, Abner was no blood
      relative of his, and Bishop had enough to occupy him in looking after the
      material interests of his own family without bothering about the spiritual
      welfare of a connection by marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dole stood up and announced a hymn, and read it from beginning to end in a
      mellow, sonorous voice. The congregation, all eying Abner, rose and sang
      it energetically; even Abner, who sang a fair bass of the rasping,
      guttural variety, popular in the mountains, found himself joining in,
      quite unconcerned as to his future right to do so. After this, Dole led in
      prayer, standing with both hands resting on the crude, unpainted stand,
      the sole ornament of which was a pitcher of water, a tumbler, and a glass
      lamp with a green paper shade on it. Abner remarked afterwards that Dole,
      in this prayer, used the Lord as a cat's-paw to hit at him. Dole told the
      Lord a few things that he had never had the courage to tell Daniel. Abner
      was a black sheep in a flock earnestly striving to keep itself white&mdash;a
      thing in human shape that soiled that with which it came in contact. He
      had the subtle tongue of the serpent that blasted the happiness of the
      primeval pair in the Garden of Eden. Under the cloak of wit and wisdom he
      was continually dropping poison into the beverages of earnest folk who had
      not the religious courage to close their ears. As a member of a
      consecrated body of souls, it was the opinion of many that Abner was out
      of place, but that was to be decided after careful investigation in the
      Lord's presence and after ample testimony pro and con had been submitted.
      Any one wishing to show that the offending member had a right to remain in
      good standing would be gladly listened to, even prayerfully. On the other
      hand, such members as had had their religious sensibilities wounded should
      feel that a most sacred duty rested on them to speak their minds. All this
      Dole said he trusted the Lord would sanction and bless in the name of the
      Lord Jesus Christ, the Saviour and Director of all men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dole then started another hymn, and when it had been sung he announced
      that no sermon would be preached that day, as the important business in
      hand would consume all available time before the dinner-hour. Then he
      courageously faced Abner. His countenance was pale and determined, his
      tone perfunctory and sharp as a knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon, brother Daniel," he said, "that you have a idee who I've been
      talkin' about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner was slightly pale, but calm and self-possessed. The light of
      merriment, always kindled by contact with Dole, danced in his eyes. "I
      kinder 'lowed I was the one," he said, slowly, "an' I'm sorter curis to
      see who' ll speak an' what they 'll say. I 'll tell you now I ain't
      a-goin' to do myse'f jestice. I 'ain't been to a debatin' club sence I was
      a boy, but I 'll do my best."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dole stroked his beard and consulted a scrap of paper in the palm of his
      hand. "Brother Throg-martin," he called out, suddenly, and a short, fat
      man on a bench behind Abner rose and cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, brother Throgmartin," went on the preacher, "jest tell some o' the
      things you've heerd brother Daniel say that struck you as bein'
      undoctrinal an' unbecomin' a member of this body."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir," Throgmartin began, in a thin, high voice that cut the
      profound silence in the room like a rusty blade, "I don't raily, in my
      heart o' hearts, believe that Ab&mdash;brother Daniel&mdash;has the right
      interpretation of Scriptur'. I remember, after you preached last summer
      about the sacred teachin' in regard to future punishment, that Ab&mdash;brother
      Daniel&mdash;an' me was walkin' home together. Ever' now an' then he'd
      stop in the road an' laugh right out sudden-like over what you'd
      contended."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he did, did he?" Dole's face hardened. He couldn't doubt that part of
      the testimony, for it was distinctly Abner's method.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," responded Throgmartin, sternly, "he 'lowed what you'd said was
      as funny to him as a circus clown's talk, an' that it was all he could do
      to hold in. He 'lowed ef you was to git up in a Darley church with sech
      talk as that they'd make you preach to niggers. He 'lowed he didn't
      believe hell was any hot place nohow, an' that he never could be made to
      believe that the Lord ud create folks an' then barbecue 'em alive through
      all eternity. He said it sorter turned his stomach to see jest a little
      lamb roasted at a big political gatherin', an' that no God he believed in
      would institute sech long torture as you spoke about when you brought up
      the mustard-seed p'int."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He deliberately gives the lie to Holy Scripture, then," said Dole, almost
      beside himself with rage. "What else did he say of a blasphemous nature?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I hardly know," hesitated the witness, his brow wrinkled
      thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," snarled Dole, "you hain't told half you said to me this mornin' on
      the way to meetin'. What was his remark about the stars havin' people on
      'em ever' bit an' grain as worthy o' salvation as us all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I disremember his exact words. Perhaps Ab&mdash;brother Daniel&mdash;will
      refresh my memory." Throg-martin was gazing quite respectfully at the
      offender. "It was at Billy Malone's log-rollin', you know, Ab; me 'n'
      you'd eat a snack together, an' you said the big poplar had strained yore
      side an' wanted to git it rubbed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner looked straight at Dole. The corners of his big, honest mouth were
      twitching defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said, I think," he answered, "that no matter what some folks mought
      believe about the starry heavens, no man ever diskivered a big world with
      a tail to it through a spy-glass without bein' convinced that thar was
      other globes in the business besides jest this un."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dole drew himself up straight and gazed broadly over his congregation. He
      felt that in the estimation of unimaginative, prosaic people like his
      flock Abner's defence would certainly fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kin I ax," he asked, sternly, "how you happen to think like you do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner grasped the back of the bench in front of him and pulled himself up,
      only to sink back hesitatingly into his seat. "Would it be out o' order
      fer me to stand?" he questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dole spread a hard, triumphant smile over the congregation. "Not at all,
      if it will help you to give a sensible answer to my question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I kin talk settin'," retorted the man on trial. "I jest didn't know
      what was right an' proper, an' I 'lowed I could hit that spit-box better
      standin' than I kin over brother Tarver's legs."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man referred to quickly slid along the bench, giving Abner his place
      near the aisle, and Abner calmly emptied his mouth in the wooden box
      filled with sawdust and wiped his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hardly know why I think like I do about other worlds," he answered,
      slowly, "unless it's beca'se I've always had the notion that the universe
      is sech a powerful, whoppin' big thing. Most folks believe that the spot
      they inhabit is about all thar is to creation, anyway. That's human
      natur'. About the biggest job I ever tackled was to drive a hungry cow
      from bad grass into a good patch. She wants to stay thar an' eat, an'
      that's about the way it is with folks. They are short-sighted. It makes
      most of 'em mad to tell 'em they kin better the'r condition. I've always
      believed that's the reason they make the bad place out so bad; they've
      made up the'r minds to live thar, an' they ain't a-goin' to misrepresent
      it. They are out o' fire-wood in this life an' want to have a good sweat
      in the next."

    <p>
      T looked as if Dole thought he could get down to the matter better out of
      the pulpit, so he descended the steps on the side near Abner, and stood on
      the floor inside the altar railing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We didn't assemble heer to argue with brother Daniel," he informed the
      congregation, "fer that's evidently jest what he'd like. It would be raily
      kind of you all to consider what he's jest said as the product of a weak
      brain ruther 'n a bad heart. Brother Throgmartin, have you any other
      charges to prefer agin brother Daniel?" Dole looked as if he had already
      been apprised of the extent of the witness's testimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all I keer to say," replied the man addressed, and he coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dole consulted the scrap of paper in his hand, and while he did so Abner
      stole a glance at Bishop and his wife. Mrs. Bishop had her handkerchief to
      her eyes as if she were crying, and her husband's face wore the impatient
      look of a man detained by trivialities.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brother Daniel," the preacher began, suddenly, "charges has been
      preferred agin you on the score that you are a profane man. What have you
      got to say on that line?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner bent his head and spat down into the hopper-shaped box in the aisle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hardly know, brother Dole," he said. "It's all owin' to what profanity
      is an' what it hain't. I don't know that I ever used but one word out o'
      the general run, an' that is 'dem.' I don't believe thar's any more harm
      in sayin' 'dem' than 'scat,' ur gruntin' when thar's no absolute call fer
      it. I don't know as anybody knows what it means. I don't. I've axed a
      number o' times, but nobody could tell me, so I knowed it wasn't patented
      anyway. Fer a long time I 'lowed nobody used it but me. I met a feller
      from up in Yankeedom that said 'darn,' an' another from out West that said
      'dang,' so I reckon they are all three in a bunch."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture some one in the rear of the church laughed out, and the
      entire congregation turned its head. It was Pole Baker. He was red in the
      face, had his big hand pressed tightly over his mouth, and was bent over
      the bench towards the open doorway. Abner's eyes sparkled with
      appreciative merriment as he saw him, but he did not permit himself to
      smile. Dole could not hide his irritation, for Pole's unalloyed enjoyment
      had communicated itself to some of the less rigid members, and he felt
      that the reply which was stinging his tongue would fall less forcefully
      than if the incident hadn't happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held up his hand to invoke silence and respect. "I believe such a word,
      to say the least, is unbecoming in a Christian, and I think the membership
      will back me up in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't look at it that away," argued Abner. "I'd be above takin' the
      Lord's name in vain, but a little word that nobody cayn't find no fault
      with or tell its origin shorely is different."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that 'll be a matter to decide by vote."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dole paused a moment and then introduced another topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A report has gone round among the members that you said that red-handed
      murderer who killed a man over in Fannin' an' was hung, an' passed on
      without a single prayer fer pardon to his Maker&mdash;that he'd stand a
      chance fer redemption. In all my experience I've never heerd sech a
      dangerous doctrin' as that, brother Daniel&mdash;never, as I myself hope
      to be redeemed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said he'd have a chance&mdash;I <i>thought</i>," said Abner. "I reckon
      I must 'a' got that idee from what Jesus said to the thief on the cross.
      You see, brother Dole, I believe the Almighty gives us all equal chances,
      an' I don't believe that feller in Fannin' had as good a opportunity to
      git his heart saftened as the feller did that was dyin' right alongside o'
      the great Redeemer o' the world. Nobody spoke a kind word to the Fannin'
      man; on the contrary, they was hootin' an' spittin' at 'im night an' day,
      an' they say the man he killed had pestered 'im all his life. Scriptur'
      says we ort to forgive a man seventy times seven, an' that is four hundred
      an' ninety. Why they didn't make it even five hundred I never could tell.
      An' yet you-uns try to make folks believe the Lord that made us, frail as
      we are an' prone to sin, won't forgive us once ef we happen to die sudden.
      Shucks! that doctrine won't hold water; it's hide-bound an' won't stretch
      one bit. It seems to me that the trouble with yore&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We haven't time to listen to a speech on the subject," interrupted the
      preacher, whose anger was inflamed by hearing Pole Baker sniggering. "If
      thar is anybody else that has anything to say we'd be glad to hear from
      'em."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mrs. Bishop rose, wiping her eyes. She was pale and deeply agitated.
      "I jest want to ax you all to be lenient with my pore brother," she began,
      her thin voice cracking under its strain. "I've predicted that he'd bring
      disrepute down on us with his ready tongue an' odd notions. I've tried an'
      tried to stop 'im, but it didn't do a bit o' good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's very good of you to speak in his behalf," said Dole, as she sank
      back into her seat. "I'm sure the membership will do its duty, sister
      Bishop."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a little, meanly clad man behind Daniel stood up. It was Jasper
      Marmaduke, a ne 'er-do-well farmer, who had a large family, few friends,
      and no earthly possessions. He was greatly excited, and as white as if he
      were on trial for his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ain't no member," he began. "I know I ort to be, but I hain't. I don't
      know whether a outsider's got a right to chip into this or not, but it
      seems to me I 'll bu'st wide open ef I don't git up heer an' say as loud
      as I kin holler that Abner Daniel's the best man I ever seed, knowed, ur
      heerd tell of." Tears were on the man's face and his voice shook with
      emotion. "He's fetched food an' medicine over to my folks an' run after a
      doctor when all the rest o' humanity had turned the'r backs on us. He made
      me promise not to cheep it to a soul, but I'm a-goin' to tell it&mdash;tell
      it, ef he never speaks to me agin. I ain't no godly man, an' this thing's
      makin' me so mad I feel like throwin' rocks!" And with a sob bursting from
      him, Marmaduke strode from the church with a loud clatter of his untied
      shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good! Good man!" spoke up Pole Baker, impulsively, unconscious of where
      he was. "Jas', yo're the right stuff." And then, in the dead silence that
      followed his ejaculation, Pole realized what he had said and lowered his
      head in red embarrassment, for Dole's fierce eyes were bearing down on
      him. The preacher's pent-up wrath burst; he was really more infuriated at
      the man who had just left the church, but he had to make an example of
      some one, and Pole had laid himself open to attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is no place fer rowdies," he snarled. "That outlaw back thar who has
      been continually disturbing these proceedings ort to be jailed. He's
      undertakin' to bring his violations of decency into the very house of
      God."
    </p>
    <p>
      A vast surprise clutched the congregation, who, knowing Pole, scented
      trouble. And Pole did not disappoint them. With his flabby hat in his
      brawny grasp, Pole stood up, but his wife, who sat on the women's side
      across the aisle from him with her three eldest children, stepped to him
      and drew him back in his seat, sitting by him and whispering imploringly.
      Dole stared fiercely for a moment, and then, seeing that the disturbance
      was over, he shrugged his broad shoulders and applied himself to the
      business in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is thar anybody else pro or con that ud like to be heerd?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the widow Pellham, sitting well towards the front, who now rose. "I
      feel like Jas' Marmaduke does," she began, falteringly. Her hearers could
      not see her face, for she wore a black calico sunbonnet, and it was tilted
      downward. "I believe I 'll be committin' of a grievous sin ef I let my
      natural back'ard-ness keep me quiet. Abner Daniel was the fust, last, an'
      only pusson that made me see the true way into God's blessed sunshine out
      o' the pitch-black darkness that was over me. All of you, especially them
      livin' nigh me, knowed how I acted when my daughter Mary died. We'd lived
      together sence she was born, an' after her pa passed away she was all I
      had. Then God up an' tuck 'er. I tell you it made a devil out'n me. I
      liter'ly cussed my Maker an' swore revenge agin 'Im. I quit meetin' an'
      closed my door agin my neighbors. They all tried to show me whar I was
      wrong, but I wouldn't listen. Some nights I set up from dark till daylight
      without candle or fire, bemeanin' my God fer the way He'd done me. You
      remember, brother Dole, that you come a time or two an' prayed an' read,
      but I didn't budge out'n my cheer an' wouldn't bend a knee. Then that
      other little preacher, that was learnin' to preach, an' tuck yore place
      when you went off to bury yore mother&mdash;he come an' made a set at me,
      but every word he said made me wuss. I ordered <i>him</i> off the hill,
      an' told 'im ef he appeared agin I'd set my dog on 'im. I don't know why
      everybody made me so mad, but they did. The devil had me by the leg, an'
      was a-drag-gin' me as fast to his hole as a dog kin trot. But one mornin'
      Abner Daniel come over with that thar devilish twinkle in his eyes that ud
      make a cow laugh, an' begun to banter me to sell 'im the hay off'n my
      little neck o' land betwixt the creek an' the road. I kept tellin' 'im I
      didn't want to sell, but he kept a-com-in' an' a comin', with no end o'
      fool talk about this un an' that un, tell somehow I got to watchin' fer
      'im, but still I wouldn't let nobody else in. Then one day, after I'd
      refused to sell an' told 'im I'd <i>give</i> 'im the hay, he growed
      serious an' said, ses he: 'Sister Pellham, I don't want the hay on that
      patch. I've been deliberately lyin'. I've been comin' over heer as a
      friend, to try to make you feel better.' Then he set in, an', as God is my
      highest judge, ef thar 'll be any more speritual talk on t'other shore it
      'll be after Abner Daniel gits thar. He jest rolled me about in his hands
      like a piece o' wheat dough. He showed me what aileded me as plain as I
      could p'int out the top o' old Bald Mountain to you on a cleer day. He
      told me, I remember, that in grievin' like I was, I was sinnin' agin the
      Holy Ghost, an' jest as long as I did it I'd suffer wuss an' wuss as a
      penalty. He said it was a fight betwixt me an' my Maker an' that I was
      bound to be worsted. He said that when my Mary come into the world I
      couldn't tell whar she was from, nur why the Lord had fetched 'er, but I
      was jest pleased beca'se it suited me to be pleased, but, ses he, when she
      went back into the great mystery o' God's beautiful plan I wasn't
      satisfied beca'se it didn't suit me to be. He said it was downright
      selfishness, that had no part nur parcel in the kingdom o' heaven. He said
      to me, ses he, 'Sister, ef you 'll jest fer one minute make up yore mind
      that Mary is in better hands 'an she was in yor'n '&mdash;an' you kin bet
      yore bottom dollar she is&mdash;'you 'll feel as light as a feather. 'I
      had a tussle, but it come, God bless him! it come. It was jest like a
      great light had bu'sted over me. I fell down on my knees before 'im an'
      shouted an' shouted till I was as limp as a wet rag. I had always thought
      I was converted away back in the sixties when I was a gal, but I wasn't. I
      got my redemption that day under Abner Daniel's talk, an' I shall bless
      'im an' sing his name on my dyin' bed. I don't want to entertain no
      spiteful feelin' s, but ef he goes out I 'll have to. I wouldn't feel
      right in no church too puore to fellowship with Abner Daniel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good! Good woman!" shouted Pole Baker, as if he were at a political
      speaking. She sat down. The house seemed profoundly moved. People were
      thinking of the good things they had heard about Abner Daniel. However,
      the turn of affairs did not suit Dole, who showed decided anger. His eyes
      flashed as they rested on Pole Baker, who had offended him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall have to ax that law-breaker back thar to leave the church," he
      said. "I think it's come to a purty pass ef strong, able-bodied
      church-members will set still an' allow the'r own house o' worship to be
      insulted by such a rascal as that one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole rose; many thought he was going to leave, but to the surprise of all
      he walked deliberately up to the altar and laid his hand upon the railing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Looky' heer," he said, "they call you the fightin' preacher. They say you
      believe in hittin' back when yo' re hit. I'm heer to show you that ef I am
      a outlaw I ain't afeerd o' you, an' I ain't a-goin' to be abused by you
      when you are under the cloak o' this meetin'. When you say some 'n' you
      think is purty good you wink at some brother in the amen-corner an' he
      yells 'Amen 'loud enough to be heerd to the cross-roads. Then you go on as
      if nothin' had happened. What I said back thar was jest my way o' sayin'
      amen. Little Jas' Marmaduke hit you in a weak spot; so did what Mis'
      Pellham said, an' yo' re tryin' to take yore spite out on me. That won't
      work. I come heer to see fair play, an' I'm a-goin' to do it. Uncle Ab's a
      good man an' I'm heer to testify to it. He's come nigher&mdash;him an'
      Alan Bishop, that's a chip off'n 'im&mdash;to turn me into the right way
      than all the shoutin'-bees I ever attended, an' I've been to as many as
      thar are hairs on my head. I ain't bald, nuther. Now ef you want to have
      it out with me jest wait an' meet me outside, whar we 'll both have fair
      play."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dole was quivering with rage. "I kin whip a dozen dirty scoundrels like
      you," he panted. "Men like you insult ministers, thinking they won't
      fight, but after meetin' I 'll simply wipe up the ground with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, 'nough said!" and Pole sat down. There was silence for a
      moment. Dole's furious panting could be heard all over the room. Then
      Abner Daniel rose. A vast change had come over him. The light of quizzical
      merriment had faded from his face; nothing lay there except the shadows of
      deepest regret. "I've been wrong&mdash;wrong&mdash;<i>wrong!</i>" he said,
      loudly. "I'm dead wrong, ur Pole Baker never would 'a' wanted to fight,
      an' brother Dole wouldn't 'a' been driv' to lose his temper in the pulpit.
      I'm at the bottom o' all this rumpus that has kept you all from listenin'
      to a good sermon. You've not found me hard to git along with when I see my
      error, an' I promise that I 'll try from this day on to keep from shovin'
      my notions on folks that ain't ready fer 'em. I want to stay in the
      church. I think every sane man an' woman kin do good in a church, an' I
      want to stay in this un."
    </p>
    <p>
      The confession was so unexpected, and furnished Dole with such an easy
      loop-hole for gracefully retiring from a most unpleasant predicament, that
      he actually beamed on the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think any more need be said," he smiled. "Brother Daniel has
      shown himself willing to do the right thing, an' I propose that the
      charges be dropped." Thereupon a vote was taken, and it went
      overwhelmingly in Abner's favor. After the benediction, which followed
      immediately, Pole Baker hurried across to Daniel. "I declare, you make me
      sick, Uncle Ab," he grumbled. "What on earth did you mean by takin'
      back-water? You had 'im whar the wool was short; he was white at the
      gills. You could 'a' mauled the life out'n 'im. Ef I'd&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Abner, smiling indulgently, had a watchful eye on Dole, and was moving
      forward to shake the preacher's outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I 'll be damned!" Pole grunted, half aloud and in high disgust, as
      he pushed his way through the crowd to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner found him waiting for him near the hitch-ing-post, where he had been
      to untie Bishop's horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon," he said, "bein' as you got so mighty good yorese'f, 'at you
      think I acted wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not any wuss'n I did, Pole," replied the old man, seriously. "My advice
      to you is to go to Dole an' tell 'im you are sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry hell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It ud be better fer you," half smiled Abner. "Ef you don't, some o' them
      hill-Billies 'll make a case at court agin you fer disturbin' public
      worship. Before a grand jury o' mossbacks a man with yore record ud not
      stand any better chance o' comin' cleer 'n a old bird-nest ud o' makin'
      good soup. When you was a-runnin' of yore still it made you powerful mad
      to have revenue men after you, didn't it? Well, this heer shebang is
      Dole's still, my boy, whar he claims to make good sperits out'n bad
      material, an' he's got a license, which is more 'n you could 'a' said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon yo' re right," said Pole. "I 'll wait fer 'im."

    <p>
      N the middle of the following week some of the young people of Darley gave
      a picnic at Morley's Spring, a beautiful and picturesque spot about a mile
      below Bishop's farm. Alan had received an urgent invitation to join the
      party, and he rode down after dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a hot afternoon, and the party of a dozen couples had scattered in
      all directions in search of cool, shady nooks. Alan was by no means sure
      that Miss Barclay would be there, but, if the truth must be told, he went
      solely with the hope of at least getting another look at her. He was more
      than agreeably surprised, for, just as he had hitched his horse to a
      hanging bow of an oak near the spring, Frank Hillhouse came from the
      tangle of wild vines and underbrush on a little hill-side and approached
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are just the fellow I'm looking for," said Frank. "Miss Dolly's over
      there in a hammock, and I want to leave somebody with her. Old man Morley
      promised me the biggest watermelon in his patch if I'd come over for it. I
      won't be long."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't care how long you are," smiled Alan. "You can stay all day if
      you want to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you wouldn't mind," grinned Frank. "I used to think you were
      the one man I had to fight, but I reckon I was mistaken. A feller in love
      imagines everybody in creation is against him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan made no reply to this, but hurried away to where Dolly sat, a new
      magazine in her hands and a box of candies on the grass at her feet. "I
      saw you riding down the hill," she said, with a pretty flush and no little
      excitement. "To tell the truth, I sent Frank after the melon when I
      recognized you. He's been threatening to go all the afternoon, but I
      insisted on it. You may be surprised, but I have a business message for
      you, and I would have made Frank drive me past your house on the way home
      if you hadn't come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Business," Alan laughed, merrily; he felt very happy in her presence
      under all her assurances of welcome. "The idea of your having a business
      message! That's really funny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's what it is; sit down." She made room for him in the hammock,
      and he sat beside her, his foolish brain in a whirl. "Why, yes, it is
      business; and it concerns you. I fancy it is important; anyway, it may
      take you to town to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mean it," he laughed. She looked very pretty, in her light
      organdie gown and big rustic hat, with its wide, flowing ribbons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it is a message from Rayburn Miller, about that railroad idea of
      yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really? Then he told you about that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; he was down to see me last week. He didn't seem to think much of it
      then&mdash;but"&mdash;she hesitated and smiled, as if over the memory of
      something amusing&mdash;"he's been thinking of it since. As Frank and I
      drove through the main street this morning&mdash;Frank had gone in a store
      to get a basket of fruit&mdash;he came to me on his way to the train for
      Atlanta. He hadn't time to say much, but he said if you were out here
      to-day to tell you to come in town to-night without fail, so as to meet
      him at his office early in the morning. He 'll be back on the midnight
      train. I asked him if it was about the railroad, and he said it was&mdash;that
      he had discovered something that looked encouraging."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad of that," said Alan, a thrill of excitement passing over him.
      "Rayburn threw cold water on my ideas the other day, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know he did, and it was a shame," said Dolly, warmly. "The idea of his
      thinking he is the only man in Georgia with originality! Anyway, I hope it
      will come to something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I certainly do," responded Alan. "It's the only thing I could think of to
      help my people, and I am willing to stake all I have on it&mdash;which is,
      after all, nothing but time and energy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, don't you let him nor any one else discourage you," said the girl,
      her eyes flashing. "A man who listens to other people and puts his own
      ideas aside is unworthy of the brain God gave him. There is another thing"&mdash;her
      voice sank lower and her eyes sought the ground. "Rayburn Miller is a
      fine, allround man, but he is not perfect by any means. He talks freely to
      me, you know; he's known me since I was knee-high. Well, he told me&mdash;he
      told me of the talk he had with you at the dance that night. Oh, that hurt
      me&mdash;hurt me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He told you that!" exclaimed Alan, in surprise. "Yes, and it actually
      disgusted me. Does he think all men ought to act on that sort of advice?
      He might, for he has made an unnatural man of himself, with all his
      fancies for new faces; but you are not that kind, Alan, and I'm sorry you
      and he are so intimate&mdash;not that he can influence you <i>much</i>,
      but he has already, <i>in a way</i>, and that has pained me deeply."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has influenced me?" cried Alan, in surprise. "I think you are
      mistaken."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may not realize it, but he has," said Dolly, with gentle and yet
      unyielding earnestness. "You see, you are so very sensitive that it would
      not be hard to make you believe that a young man ought not to keep on
      caring for a girl whose parents object to his attentions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" He had caught her drift.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. At the foot of the hill a little brook ran merrily over
      the water-browned stones, and its monotonous lapping could be heard
      distinctly. Under the trees across the open some of the couples had drawn
      together and were singing:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "I see the boat go 'round the bend,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Good-bye, my lover, good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly had said exactly what he had never hoped to hear her say, and the
      fact of her broaching such a subject in such a frank, determined way sent
      a glow of happiness all over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think," he began, thoughtfully, "that Rayburn or any man could
      keep me from"&mdash;he looked into her full, expectant eyes, and then
      plunged madly&mdash;"could keep me from caring for you, from loving you
      with all my heart, Dolly; but it really is a terrible thing to know that
      you are robbing a girl of not only the love of her parents but her
      rightful inheritance, when, when"&mdash;he hurried on, seeing that an
      impulse to speak was urging her to protest&mdash;"when you haven't a cent
      to your name, and, moreover, have a black eye from your father's
      mistakes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew that's what he'd said!" declared the girl, almost white with
      anger. "I knew it! Oh, Alan, Rayburn Miller might be able to draw back and
      leave a girl at such a time, but no man could that truly loves as&mdash;as
      I believe you love me. I have known how you have felt all this time, and
      it has nearly broken my heart, but I could not write to you when you had
      never even told me, what you have to-day. You must not let anybody or
      anything influence you, Alan. I'd rather be a poor man' s wife, and do my
      own work, than let a paltry thing like my father's money keep me from
      standing by the man I love."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan' s face was ablaze. He drew himself up and gazed at her, all his soul
      in his eyes. "Then I shall not give you up," he declared; "not for
      anything in the world. And if there is a chance in the railroad idea I
      shall work at it ten times as hard, now that I have talked with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat together in blissful ignorance of the passage of time, till some
      one shouted out that Frank Hill-house was coming with the watermelon. Then
      all the couples in sight or hearing ran to the spring, where Hillhouse
      could be seen plunging the big melon into the water. Hattie Alexander and
      Charlie Durant, who had been perched on a jutting bowlder high up on the
      hill behind Dolly and Alan, came half running, half sliding down, catching
      at the trees to keep from falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better come get your teeth in that melon," Hattie said, with a knowing
      smile at Dolly. They lived next door to each other and were quite
      intimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, Alan." Dolly rose. "Frank will never forgive me if I don't have
      some."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sha 'n' t have time, if I go to town to-night," replied Alan. "I have
      something to do at home first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I won't keep you," Dolly smiled, "for you must go and meet Rayburn
      Miller. I'm going to hope that he has had good luck in Atlanta."
    </p>
    <p>
      The world had never seemed so full of joy and hope as Alan rode homeward.
      The sun was setting in glorious splendor beyond the towering mountains,
      above which the sky seemed an ocean of mother-of-pearl and liquid gold.
      Truly it was good to be alive. At the bars he met Abner Daniel with a
      fishing-cane in his hands, his bait-gourd under his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know right whar you've been," he said, with a broad smile, as he threw
      down the bars for Alan to pass through. "I seed that gang drive by in all
      the'r flurry this mornin', the queen bee in the lead with that little
      makeshift of a man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan dismounted to prevent his uncle from putting up the bars, and they
      walked homeward side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and I've had the time of my life," said the young man. "I talked to
      her for a solid hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could see that in yore face," said Abner, quietly. "You couldn't hide
      it, an' I 'll bet she didn't lose time in lettin' you know what she never
      could hide from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We understand each other better now," admitted Alan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I've certainly set my heart on the match&mdash;on gittin' her in
      our family," affirmed Abner. "Durn-ed ef&mdash;I declare, sometimes I'm
      afeerd I'm gone on 'er myse'f. Yes, I want you 'n' her to make it. I want
      to set an' smoke an' chaw on yore front porch, an' heer her back in the
      kitchen fryin' ham an' eggs, an'," the old man winked, "I don't know as
      I'd object to trottin' some 'n' on my knee, to sorter pass the time
      betwixt meals."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, come off, Uncle Ab!" said Alan, with a flush, "that's going too far."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man whisked his bait-gourd round under his other arm. His eyes
      twinkled, and he chuckled. "'Tain' t goin' as fur as havin' one on each
      knee an' both pine blank alike an' exactly the same age. I've knowed that
      to happen in my day an' time, when nobody wasn't even lookin' fer a'
      increase."

      ATTIE ALEXANDER and Charlie Durant reached home before Dolly and
      Hillhouse, and as Dolly alighted from the buggy at the front gate and was
      going up the flower-bordered walk Hattie came to the side fence and called
      out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Dolly, come here quick; I've got some 'n' to tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, wait till I get my hat off," answered Dolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I can't wait; come on, or you 'll wish you had."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, goosie?" Dolly smiled, as she tripped across the grass, her
      face flushed from her rapid drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doll, darling, I've got you in an <i>awful</i> scrape. I know you 'll
      never forgive me, but I couldn't help it. When Charlie left me at the gate
      mother come out and asked me all about the picnic, who was there an' who
      talked to who, and all about it. Among other things I told her about you
      and Alan getting together for such a nice, long talk, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't mind her," broke in Dolly, as she reached for the skirt of
      her gown to rescue it from the dew on the high grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait, wait; I'm not through by a jugful," panted Hattie. "Just then your
      pa came along an' asked if you'd got home. I told him you hadn't, an' then
      he up and asked me if Alan Bishop was out there. I had to say yes, of
      course, for you know how strict mother is about telling a fib, and then
      what do you think he did? He come right out plain and asked if Alan talked
      to you by yourself. I didn't know what on earth to do. I reckon I actually
      turned white, and then mother chipped in and said: 'Tell the truth,
      daughter; a story never mends matters; besides, Colonel Barclay, you must
      be more reasonable; young folks will be young folks, and Alan Bishop would
      be my choice if I was picking out a husband for my girl.' And then you
      ought to have heard your pa snort; it was as loud as a horse kicking up
      his heels in the lot. He wheeled round an' made for the house like he was
      shot out of a gun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon he 'll raise the very Old Harry," opined Dolly, grimly. "But I
      don't care; he's driven me about as far as he can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't make him any madder," advised the innocent mischief-maker,
      with a doleful expression. "It's all my fault. I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it wasn't," declared Dolly. "But he can't run over me with his
      unreasonable ideas about Alan Bishop."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that she turned and went towards the house, her head down. On the
      veranda she met her mother, who was waiting for her with a pleasurable
      smile. "You've stirred up yore pa awful," she said, laughing impulsively,
      and then trying to veil it with a seriousness that sat awkwardly on her.
      "You'd better dodge him right now. Oh, he's hot! He was just saying this
      morning that he believed you and Frank were getting on fine, and now he
      says Frank is an idiot to take a girl to a picnic to meet his rival. How
      did it happen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as I intended it should, mother," Dolly said. "I knew he was coming,
      and sent Frank off after a watermelon. He didn't have sense enough to see
      through my ruse. If I'd treated Alan that way he'd simply have looked
      straight through me as if I'd been a window-pane. Mother, I'm not going to
      put up with it. I tell you I won't. I know what there is in Alan Bishop
      better than father does, and I am not going to stand it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ain't, heigh?" thundered Barclay across the hall, and he stalked out
      of the sitting-room, looking over his eye-glasses, a newspaper in his
      hand. "Now, my lady, let me say to you that Alan Bishop shall never darken
      my door, and if you meet him again anywhere you shall go away and stay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father "&mdash;Dolly had never stood so tall in her high-heeled shoes nor
      so straight&mdash;"Father, you insulted Alan just now before Mrs.
      Alexander and Hattie, and I'm not going to have you do it any more. I love
      him, and I shall never love any other man, nor marry any other man. I know
      he loves me, and I'm going to stick to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then the quicker you get away from here the better," said the old man,
      beside himself with rage. "And when you go, don't you dare to come back
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel stalked from the room. Dolly glanced at her mother, who had a
      pale smile of half-frightened enjoyment on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you said 'most too much," Mrs. Barclay said. "You'd better not
      drive him too far."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly went up to her room, and when supper was called, half an hour later,
      she declined to come down. However, Mrs. Barclay sent up a tray of
      delicacies by Aunt Milly, the old colored woman, which came back
      untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the custom of the family to retire rather early at that season of
      the year, and by half-past nine the house was dark and still. Mrs. Barclay
      dropped to sleep quickly, but waked about one o' clock, and lay unable to
      drift into unconsciousness again for the delightful pastime of thinking
      over her daughter's love affair. She began to wonder if Dolly, too, might
      not be awake, and the prospect of a midnight chat on that of all topics
      made her pulse beat quickly. Slipping noiselessly out of bed, so as not to
      wake her husband, who was snoring in his bed across the room, she glided
      up-stairs. She had not been there a moment before the Colonel was waked by
      a low scream from her, and then he heard her bare feet thumping on the
      floor overhead as she crossed the hall into the other rooms. She screamed
      out again, and the Colonel sprang up, grasped his revolver, which always
      lay on the bureau, and ran into the hall. There he met his wife, half
      sliding down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dolly's gone," she gasped. "Her bed hasn't been touched. Oh, Seth, do you
      reckon anything has happened to her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man stared in the dim light of the hall, and then turned towards
      the door which opened on the back veranda. He said not a word, but was
      breathing hard. The cabin of old Ned and his wife, Aunt Milly, was near
      by.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ned; oh, Ned!" called out the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, marster!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Crawl out o' that bed and come heer!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, marster; I'm a-comin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Seth, do you reckon&mdash;do you&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dry up, will you?" thundered Barclay. "Are you comin', Ned?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Ned's gray head was thrust out at the partly open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want me, marster?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; what do you suppose I called you for if I didn't want you. Now I
      don't want any lies from you. You know you can't fool me. I want to know
      if you carried a note from this house to anybody since sundown."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A note must have been sent," ventured Mrs. Barclay, in an undertone.
      "Dolly never would have gone to him. He must have been notified and come
      after her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dry up, for God's sake!" yelled the Colonel over his shoulder to the
      spectre by his side. "Answer me, you black rascal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marse Seth, young miss, she&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She sent a note to Alan Bishop, didn't she?" interpolated the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marster, I didn't know it was any harm. I des 'lowed it was some prank o'
      young miss'. Oh, Lordy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might know you'd do suppen, you old sap-haid," broke in Aunt Milly
      from the darkness of the cabin. "I kin count on you ever' time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get back in bed," ordered the Colonel, and he walked calmly into his room
      and lay down again. His wife followed him, standing in the middle of the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aren't you going to do anything?" she said. Her voice was charged with a
      blending of tears and a sort of feminine eagerness that is beyond the
      comprehension of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do anything? What do you think I ought to do? Raise an alarm, ring the
      church-bells, and call out the hook-and-ladder company? Huh! She's made
      her bed; let her lie on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are heartless&mdash;you have no feeling," cried his wife. The very
      core of her desire was to get him to talk about the matter. If he was not
      going to rouse the neighborhood, and thus furnish some one to talk to, he,
      at least, ought to be communicative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you'd better go to bed," snarled her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No"&mdash;she scratched a match and lighted a candle&mdash;"I'm going
      up-stairs and see if she left a note. Now, you see, <i>I</i> had to think
      of that. The poor girl may have written something."
    </p>
    <p>
      There did seem to be a vestige of reason in this, and the old man said
      nothing against it, throwing himself back on his pillow with a stifled
      groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      After about half an hour Mrs. Barclay came back; she stood over him,
      holding the candle so that its best rays would fall on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She didn't write one word," was her announcement. "I reckon she knew we'd
      understand or find out from Uncle Ned. And just to think!"&mdash;Mrs.
      Barclay now sat down on a chair across the back of which lay the Colonel's
      trousers, holding the candle well to the right that she might still see
      the rigid torture of his face&mdash;"just to think, she's only taken the
      dress she had on at the picnic. It will be a poor wedding for her, when
      she's always said she wanted a lot of bridesmaids and ushers and
      decorations. Poor child! Maybe they had to drive into the country to get
      somebody to marry them. I know brother Lapsley wouldn't do it without
      letting us know. I reckon she 'll send the first thing in the morning for
      her trunk, if&mdash;" Mrs. Barclay gazed more steadily&mdash;"if she don't
      come herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, she needn't come herself," grunted the reclining figure as it
      flounced under the sheets to turn its face to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wouldn't be that hard on our only child, just because she&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you don't go to bed," the words rebounded from the white plastering an
      inch from the speaker's lips, "you 'n' me 'll have a row. I've said what
      I'd do, and I shall do it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm going out to speak to Aunt Milly a minute," said Mrs. Barclay,
      and, drawing on a thin graywrapper and sliding her bare feet into a pair
      of slippers, she shuffled out to the back porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here, Aunt Milly," she called out, and she sat down on the highest
      step and waited till the fat old woman, enveloped in a coarse gray
      blanket, joined her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aunt Milly, did you ever hear the like?" she said. "She 'ain't made off
      sho 'nough, have she, Miss Annie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, she's gone an' done it; her pa drove her just a little too far. I
      reckon she railly does love Alan Bishop, or thinks she does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could take a stick an' baste the life out'n Ned," growled the black
      woman, leaning against the veranda post; she knew better than to sit down
      in the presence of her mistress, even if her mistress had invited her to
      talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he didn't know any better," said Mrs. Barclay. "He always would trot
      his legs off for Dolly, and"&mdash;Mrs. Barclay's tone was tentative&mdash;"it
      wouldn't surprise me if Alan Bishop paid him to help to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he didn't help, Miss Annie. Ned's been in bed ever since he come back
      fum town des atter supper. He tol' me des now dat de young man was in a
      room at de hotel playin' cyards wid some more boys an' he got up an' writ
      Miss Dolly er note; but Ned went straight to bed when he got home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, Alan must have got her to meet him at the front gate, don't you
      reckon? He didn't drive up to the house either, for I think I would have
      heard the wheels. He must have left his turn-out at the corner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you a-goin' to set there all night?" thundered the Colonel from his
      bed. "How do you expect anybody to sleep with that low mumbling going on,
      like a couple of dogs under the house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Barclay got up, with a soft, startled giggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He can' t sleep because he's bothered," she said, in a confidential
      undertone. "We'd better go in. I don't want to nag him too far; it's going
      hard with Dolly as it is. I'm curious to see if he really will refuse to
      let her come back. Do you reckon he will, Milly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sw'ar I don't know, Miss Annie," replied the dark human shape from the
      depths of her blanket. "He sho is a caution, an' you kin see he's
      tormented. I 'll bet Ned won't have a whole skin in de mornin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel, despite his sullen effort to conceal the fact from his
      wide-awake wife, slept very little during the remainder of that night, and
      when he rose at the usual hour he went out to see his horse fed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Barclay was fluttering from the dining-room to the kitchen, gossiping
      with the cook, who had run out of anything to say on the subject and could
      only grunt, "Yes'um, and no'um," according to the reply she felt was
      expected. Aunt Milly was taking a plate of waffles into the dining-room
      when a little negro boy, about five years of age, the son of the cook at
      the Alexanders', crawled through a hole in the fence between the two
      houses and sauntered towards the kitchen. On the door-step he espied a
      black kitten that took his fancy and he caught it and began to stroke it
      with his little black hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What you want <i>now?</i>" Aunt Milly hovered over him like an angry hen.
      "Want ter borrow suppen, I boun' you; yo'-alls folks is de beatenes'
      people ter borrow I ever lived alongst."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy seemed to have forgotten his errand in his admiration for the
      kitten.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What you atter now?" snarled Aunt Milly, "eggs, flour, sugar, salt,
      pepper, flat-iron? Huh, we-all ain't keepin' er sto'."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy looked up suddenly and drew his ideas together with a jerk. "Miss
      Dolly, she say sen 'er Mother Hubbub wrappin' dress, hangin' on de foot er
      her bed-post."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" gasped Aunt Milly, and, hearing the exclamation, Mrs. Barclay came
      to the door and paused to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Dolly," repeated the boy, "she say sen 'er 'er wrappin' dress off'n
      de foot-post er 'er bed; en, en, she say keep 'er two waffles hot en, en
      dry&mdash;not sobby&mdash;en ter git 'er dat fresh cream fer 'er coffee in
      'er lill pitcher whut she lef' in de ice-box."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dolly? Dolly?" cried Mrs. Barclay. "You are surely mistaken, Pete. Where
      did you see her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Over 't we-all's house," said the boy, grabbing the kitten which had slid
      from his momentarily inattentive fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Over 't yo'-all's house!" cried Milly, almost in a tone of horror, "en,
      en is her husban' wid 'er?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy grinned contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh, Miss Dolly ain't no married ooman&mdash;you know she ain't, huh! I
      seh, married! Look heer"&mdash;to the kitten&mdash;"don't you scratch me,
      boy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Barclay bent over him greatly excited. "What was she doing over at
      your house, Pete?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothin' w'en I seed 'er 'cep'jest her en Miss Hattie lyin' in de bed
      laughin' en car'yin' on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Lordy!" Mrs. Barclay's eyes were riveted on Aunt Milly's beaming
      face, "do you reckon&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's slep 'over dar many times before now, Miss Annie," said Aunt Milly,
      and she burst into a round, ringing laugh, her fat body shaking like a
      mass of jelly. "She done it time en ergin&mdash;time en ergin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, ain't that a purty mess?" said Mrs. Barclay, almost in a tone of
      disappointment. "I 'll get the wrapper, Pete, and you tell her to put it
      on and hurry over here as soon as she possibly can."
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later Dolly came from the Alexander's and met her mother at
      the gate. "Oh, Dolly," Mrs. Barclay cried, "you've got us in an awful
      mess. We missed you about midnight and we thought&mdash;your father made
      Ned acknowledge that he took a note to Alan Bishop from you, and we
      thought you had gone off to get married. Your father's in an awful temper,
      swearing you shall never&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly tossed her head angrily. "Well, you needn't say I got you into it;
      you did it yourselves and I don't care how much you suffer. I say! When I
      go to get married it will not be that way, you can depend on it. Now, I
      reckon, it will be all over town that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it needn't get out of the family," Mrs. Barclay assured her, in a
      guilty tone of apology. "Your pa wouldn't let me raise any alarm. But you
      <i>did</i> send a note to Alan Bishop, Dolly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I knew he was in town, and would be here to-day, and I simply wrote
      him that father was angry at our seeing each other again and that I hoped
      he would avoid meeting him just now&mdash;that was all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, well." Mrs. Barclay hurried through the house and out to
      where Barclay stood at the lot fence watching Ned curry his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you reckon?" she gasped. "Dolly didn't go off at all; she just
      went to spend the night with Hattie Alexander."
    </p>
    <p>
      His face changed its expression against his will; the blood flowed into
      the pallor and a satisfied gleam shot from his half-closed eyes. He turned
      from her, looking over the fence at the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're leavin' a splotch on that right hind leg," he said. "Are you stone
      blind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was gittin' roun' to it, marster," said the negro, looking his surprise
      over such an unexpected reproof. "No; she just wrote Alan that you was
      displeased at them getting together yesterday and advised him to dodge you
      to-day while he is in town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he'd better!" said the Colonel, gruffly, as they walked towards the
      house. "You tell her," he enjoined&mdash;"you tell her what I said when I
      thought she <i>was</i> gone. It will be a lesson to her. She can tell now
      how I 'll do if she <i>does</i> go against me in this matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon you are glad she didn't run off," replied his wife thoughtfully.
      "The Lord only knows what you'd do about writing your letters without her
      help. I believe she knows more about your business right now than you do,
      and has a longer head. You'd' a' saved a thousand dollars by taking her
      advice the other day about that cotton sale."

    <p>
      N his way to Rayburn Miller's office that morning Alan decided that he
      would not allude to the note he had received the previous evening from
      Dolly. He did not like the cynical mood into which such subjects seemed to
      draw his friend. He knew exactly what Miller would say, and felt that it
      would be too personal to be agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the lawyer standing in the door of his little office building
      waiting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon my message surprised you," Miller said, tentatively, as he shook
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It took me off my feet," smiled Alan. "You see, I never hoped to get you
      interested in that scheme, and when I heard you were actually going to
      Atlanta about it, I hardly knew what to make of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller turned into his office, kicked a chair towards Alan and dropped
      into his creaking rocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not due to you that I did get interested," he said. "Do you know,
      I can't think of it without getting hot all over with shame. To tell you
      the truth, there is one thing I have always been vain about. I didn't
      honestly think there was a man in Georgia that could give me any tips
      about investments, but I had to take back water, and for a woman. Think of
      that&mdash;a woman knocked me off my perch as clean and easy as she could
      stick a hair-pin in a ball of hair. I'm not unfair; when anybody teaches
      me any tricks, I acknowledge the corn an' take off my hat. It was this
      way: I dropped in to see Miss Dolly the other evening. I accidentally
      disclosed two things in an offhand sort of way. I told her some of the
      views I gave you at the dance in regard to marriage and love and one thing
      and another, and then, in complimenting you most highly in other things, I
      confess I sort o' poked fun at your railroad idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you had," said Alan, good-naturedly; "but go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, she first read me a lecture about bad, empty, shallow men, whose
      very souls were damned by their past careers, interfering with the pure
      impulses of younger men, and I 'll swear I felt like crawling in a hole
      and pulling the hole in after me. Well, I got through that, in a fashion,
      because she didn't want me to see her real heart, and that helped me. Then
      she took up the railroad scheme. You know I had heard that she advised her
      father in all his business matters, but, geewhilikins! I never dreamt she
      could give me points, but she did&mdash;she simply did. She looked me
      straight in the eye and stared at me like a national bank examiner as she
      asked me to explain why that particular road could not be built, and why
      it would not be a bonanza for the owners of the timber-land. I thought she
      was an easy fish at first, and I gave her plenty of line, but she kept
      peppering me with unanswerable questions till I lay down on the bank as
      weak as a rag. The first bliff she gave me was in wanting to know if there
      were not many branch roads that did not own their rolling stock. She said
      she knew one in the iron belt in Alabama that didn't own a car or an
      engine, and wouldn't have them as a free gift. She said if such a road
      were built as you plan these two main lines would simply fall over each
      other to send out cars to be loaded for shipment at competitive rates. By
      George! it was a corker. I found out the next day that she was right, and
      that doing away with the rolling stock, shops, and so forth, would cut
      down the cost of your road more than half."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a fact," exclaimed Alan, "and I had not thought of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's a stronger woman than I ever imagined," said Miller. "By George! if
      she were not on your string, I'd make a dead set for her. A wife like that
      would make a man complete. She's in love with you&mdash;or thinks she is&mdash;but
      she hasn't that will o' the wisp glamour. She's business from her toes to
      her fingertips. By George! I believe she makes a business of her love
      affair; she seems to think she 'll settle it by a sum in algebra. But to
      get back to the railroad, for I've got lots to tell you. What do you
      reckon I found that day? You couldn't guess in a thousand years. It was a
      preliminary survey of a railroad once planned from Darley right through
      your father's purchase to Morganton, North Carolina. It was made just
      before the war, by old Colonel Wade, who, in his day, was one of the most
      noted surveyors in the State. This end of the line was all I cared about,
      and that was almost as level as a floor along the river and down the
      valley into the north end of town. It's a bonanza, my boy. Why that big
      bottle of timber-land has never been busted is a wonder to me. If as many
      Yankees had been nosing about here as there have been in other Southern
      sections it would have been snatched up long ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm awfully glad to hear you say all this," said Alan, "for it is the
      only way out of our difficulty, and something has to be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may cost you a few years of the hardest work you ever bucked down to,"
      said Miller, "and some sleepless nights, but I really believe you have
      fallen on to a better thing than any I ever struck. I could make it whiz.
      I've already done something that will astonish you. I happen to know
      slightly Tillman Wilson, the president of the Southern Land and Timber
      Company. Their offices are in Atlanta. I knew he was my man to tackle, so
      when I got to Atlanta yesterday I ran upon him just as if it were
      accidental. I invited him to lunch with me at the Capitol City Club&mdash;you
      know I'm a non-resident member. You see, I knew if I put myself in the
      light of a man with something to sell, he'd hurry away from me; but I
      didn't. As a pretext, I told him I had some clients up here who wanted to
      raise a considerable amount of money and that the security offered was
      fine timber-land. You see that caught him; he was on his own ground. I saw
      that he was interested, and I boomed the property to the skies. The more I
      talked the more he was interested, till it was bubbling out all over him.
      He's a New-Englander, who thinks a country lawyer without a Harvard
      education belongs to an effete civilization, and I let him think he was
      pumping me. I even left off my g's and ignored my r's. I let him think he
      had struck the softest thing of his life. Pretty soon he begun to want to
      know if you cared to sell, but I skirted that indifferently as if I had no
      interest whatever in it. I told him your father had bought the property to
      hold for an advance, that he had spent years of his life picking out the
      richest timber spots and buying them up. Then he came right out, as I
      hoped he would, and asked me the amount you wanted to borrow on the
      property. I had to speak quick, and remembering that you had said the old
      gentleman had put in about twenty thousand first and last, I put the
      amount at twenty-five thousand. I was taking a liberty, but I can easily
      get you out of it if you decide not to do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twenty-five thousand! On that land?" Alan cried. "It would tickle my
      father to death to sell it for that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can arrange the papers so that you are not liable for any security
      outside of the land, and it would practically amount to a sale if you
      wished it, but you don't wish it. I finally told him that I had an idea
      that you would sell out for an even hundred thousand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A hundred thousand!" repeated Alan, with a cheery laugh. "Yes, we'd let
      go at that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the figures didn't scarce him a bit, for he finally came right out
      and asked me if it was my opinion that in case his company made the loan,
      you would agree to give him the refusal of the land at one hundred
      thousand. I told him I didn't know, that I thought it possible, but that
      just then I had no interest in the matter beyond borrowing a little money
      on it. He asked me how long I was going to stay in Atlanta. I told him I
      was going to a bank and take the night train back. 'The banks will stick
      you for a high rate of interest,' he said, jealously. 'They don't do
      business for fun, while, really, our concern happens just now to have some
      idle capital on hand. Do you think you could beat five per cent.? I
      admitted that it was low enough, but I got up as if I was suddenly
      reminded that the banks close early in the afternoon. 'I think we can make
      the loan,' he said, 'but I must first see two or three of the directors.
      Can't you give me two hours?' I finally gave in and promised to meet him
      at the Kimball House at four. I went to a matine, saw it half over, and
      went in at the ladies' entrance of the hotel. I saw him looking about for
      me and dodged him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dodged him?" echoed Alan. "Why&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller laughed. "You don't suppose I'd let a big fish like that see me
      flirting my hook and pole about in open sunlight, do you? I saw by his
      manner that he was anxious to meet me, and that was enough; besides, you
      can't close a deal like that in a minute, and there are many slips. I went
      back to the club and threw myself on a lounge and began to smoke and read
      an afternoon paper. Presently he came in a cab. I heard him asking for me
      in the hall and buried my head in the paper. He came in on me and I rose
      and looked stupid. I can do it when I try&mdash;if it <i>is</i> something
      God has failed at&mdash;and I began to apologize.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He didn't seem to care. 'If it had been a deal of your own,' he said with
      a laugh, 'you'd have been more prompt,' and I managed to look guilty. Then
      he sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Our directors are interested,' he said, confidentially. 'The truth is
      there is not another concern in America that can handle that property as
      cheaply as we can. We happen to have a railroad about that length up in
      East Tennessee that has played out, and you see we could move it to where
      it would do some good.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "As soon as he told me that I knew he was our meat; besides, I saw trade
      in his eye as big as an arc-light. To make a long tale short, he is coming
      up here tonight, and if your father is willing to accept the loan, he can
      get the money, giving only the land as security&mdash;provided we don't
      slip up. Here's the only thing I'm afraid of. When Wilson gets here he may
      get to making inquiries around and drop on to the report that your father
      is disgusted with his investment, and smell a mouse and pull off. What I
      want to do is to get at him the first thing after breakfast in the
      morning, so you'd better bring your father and mother in early. If we once
      get Wilson's twenty-five thousand into it, we can eventually sell out. The
      main thing is the loan. Don't you think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I certainly do," said Alan. "Of course, a good many things might
      interfere; we'd have to get a right of way and a charter before the road
      could be built, and I reckon they won't buy till they are sure of those
      things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No it may take a long time and a lot of patience," said Miller. "But your
      father could afford to wait if he can get his money back by means of the
      loan. I tell you that's the main thing. If I had offered to sell Wilson
      the whole thing at twenty-five thousand he never would have come up here,
      but he is sure now that the property is just what he is looking for. Oh,
      we are not certain of him by a long jump! It all depends on whether he
      will insist on going over there or not. If he does, those moss-backs will
      bu'st the thing wide open. If he comes straight to my office in the
      morning the deal may be closed, but if he lies around the hotel talking,
      somebody will spoil our plans and Wilson will hang off to make his own
      terms later&mdash;if he makes any at all. It's ticklish, but we may win."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It <i>is</i> a rather ticklish situation," admitted Alan, "but even if we
      do get the loan on the property, don't you think Wilson may delay matters
      and hope to scoop the property in for the debt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He might," Miller smiled, "if he didn't want to move that railroad
      somewhere else, and, besides, your father can keep the money in suitable
      shape to pay off the note in any emergency and free himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know how to thank you, old man," answered Alan. "If you had been
      personally interested in this you could not have done more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller threw himself back in his chair and smiled significantly. "Do I
      look like a man with nothing in it?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you haven't anything in it," retorted Alan, wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all you know about it" Miller laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the road is built I 'll make by it. This is another story. As soon as
      I saw you were right about putting a railroad into the mountains, I began
      to look around for some of that timber-land. I didn't have long to wait,
      for the only man that holds much of it besides Colonel Barclay&mdash;Peter
      Mosely, whom Perkins fooled just as he did your father&mdash;came in. He
      was laying for me, I saw it in his eye. The Lord had delivered him to me,
      and I was duly thankful. He was a morsel I liked to look at. He opened up
      himself, bless you! and bragged about his fine body of virgin timber. I
      looked bored, but let him run on till he was tired; then I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, Mosely, what do you intend to do with your white elephant? You
      know it's not just the sort Barnum is looking for.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "He kind o' blinked at that, but he said, 'I've half a notion to sell. The
      truth is, I've got the finest investment open to me that I ever had. If I
      could afford to wait a few years I could coin money out of this property,
      but I believe in turning money quick.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'So do I,' said I, and watched him flirt about in the frying-pan. Then I
      said, 'What is the price you hold it at?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I thought,' said he, 'that I ought to get as much as I paid.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'As much as you paid Abe Tompkins and Perkins?' I said, with a grin. 'Do
      you think you could possibly sell a piece of land for as much as those
      sharks? If you can, you'd better go in the real-estate business. You'd
      coin money. Why, they yanked two thousand out of you, didn't they?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I don't really think Perkins had anything to do with it,' he said.
      'That's just a report out about old man Bishop's deal. I bought my land on
      my own judgment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well,' I said, 'how will fifteen hundred round wheels strike you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I believe I 'll take you up,' he said. 'I want to make that other
      investment.' So we closed and I went at once to have the deed recorded
      before he had a chance to change his mind. Now, you see, I'm interested in
      the thing, and I'm going to help you put it through. If your folks want
      the loan, bring them in in the morning, and if we can manage our Yankee
      just right, we 'll get the money."

      FTER supper that evening the Bishops sat out on the veranda to get the
      cool air before retiring. There was only one light burning in the house,
      and that was the little, smoky lamp in the kitchen, where the cook was
      washing the dishes. Bishop sat near his wife, his coat off and vest
      unbuttoned, his chair tilted back against the weatherboarding. Abner
      Daniel, who had been trying ever since supper to cheer them up in regard
      to their financial misfortune, sat smoking in his favorite chair near the
      banisters, on top of which he now and then placed his stockinged feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't talk that away, brother Ab," sighed Mrs. Bishop. "Yo're jest
      doin' it out o' goodness o' heart. We might as well face the truth; we've
      got to step down from the position we now hold, an' present way o' livin'.
      And thar's Adele. Pore child! She said in 'er last letter that she'd cried
      'er eyes out. She was bent on comin' home, but 'er uncle William won't let
      'er. He said she'd not do any good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' she wouldn't," put in Bishop, gruffly. "The sight o' you an' Alan
      before me all the time is enough to show me what a fool I've been."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are both crossin' bridges 'fore you git to 'em," said Abner. "A lots
      o' folks has come out'n scrapes wuss'n what you are in, ten to one.
      I'ain't never mentioned it, but my land hain't got no mortgage on it, an'
      I could raise a few scads, to he'p keep up yore intrust an' taxes till you
      could see yore way ahead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh!" snorted his brother-in-law. "Do you reckon I'd let as old a man as
      you are, an' no blood kin, stake his little all to help me out of a hole
      that is gittin' deeper an' wider all the time&mdash;a hole I deliberately
      got myse'f into? Well, not much!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't listen to that nuther," declared Mrs. Bishop, "but not many
      men would offer it."
    </p>
    <p>
      They heard a horse trotting down the road and all bent their heads to
      listen. "It's Alan," said Abner. "I was thinkin' it was time he was
      showin' up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bishop rose wearily to order the cook to get his supper ready, and
      returned to the veranda just as Alan Was coming from the stable. He sat
      down on the steps, lashing the legs of his dusty trousers with his
      riding-whip. It was plain that he had something of importance to say and
      they all waited in impatient silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father," he said, "I've had a talk with Rayburn Miller about your land;
      he and I have lately been working on a little idea of mine. You know there
      are people who will lend money on real-estate. How would it suit you to
      borrow twenty-five thousand dollars on that land, giving that alone as
      security."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a startled silence, and Bishop broke it in a tone of great
      irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you take me fer a plumb fool?" he asked. "When I want you an' Miller
      to dabble in my business I 'll call on you. Twenty-five thousand, I say!
      If I could exchange every acre of it fer enough to lift the mortgage on
      this farm an' keep a roof over our heads I'd do it gladly. Pshaw!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another silence, and then Alan began to explain. He almost
      seemed to his father and mother to be some stranger, as he sat there in
      the half dark ness, his eyes hidden by the brim of his soft hat, and told
      them how he had worried over their trouble till the idea of building a
      railroad had come to him. Then Miller had become interested, after
      discouraging him, and had gone to Atlanta to see Wilson, and it remained
      for the next day to decide what the outcome would be in regard to the big
      loan.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he talked Mrs. Bishop sat like a figure cut from stone, and Bishop
      leaned forward, his elbows on his knees, his big face in his hands. It was
      as if a tornado of hope had blown over him, shaking him through and
      through.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You been doin' this to he'p me out," he gasped, "an' I never so much as
      axed yore opinion one way or another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd rather see you make money out of that purchase than anything in the
      world," said his son, with feeling. "People have made fun of you in your
      old age, but if we can build the road and you can get your hundred
      thousand dollars some of these folks will laugh on the other side of their
      faces."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop was so full of excitement and emotion that he dared not trust his
      voice to utterance. He leaned back against the wall and closed his eyes,
      pretending to be calm, though his alert wife saw that he was quivering in
      every limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Alan," she cried, "don't you see how excited your pa is? You ought
      not to raise his hopes this way on such an uncertainty. As Mr. Miller
      said, there may be some slip and we'd be right back where we was, and feel
      wuss than ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop rose from his chair and began to walk to and fro on the veranda.
      "It ain't possible," they heard him saying. "I won't git out as easy as
      that&mdash;I jest cayn't!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps it would be wrong to expect too much," said Alan, "but I was
      obliged to tell you what we are going in town for to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop wheeled and paused before them. "Ef Wilson puts up the money I'd
      have enough to lift the mortgage an' a clean twenty thousand besides to
      put in some good investment."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Maria, the colored cook, came out and timidly announced that Alan's
      supper was on the table, but no one heard her. She crossed the veranda and
      touched the young man on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supper's raidy, Marse Alan," she said, "en it's gittin' col' ergin."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and followed her into the dining-room and sat down in his
      accustomed place at the long table. When he had eaten he went back to the
      group on the veranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I 'll go up to bed," he told them. "My ride and running around at
      Darley has made me very tired. Father, get all your papers together and
      let's take an early start in the morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      But despite his feeling of weariness, Alan found he could not sleep. The
      bright moonlight, streaming in at his window, seemed a disturbing element.
      About eleven o'clock he heard some one turning the windlass at the well,
      and later the clatter of falling utensils in the kitchen, and the dead
      thump of a heavy tread below. He knew then that his father was up, and,
      like himself, unable to sleep. Presently Mrs. Bishop slipped into his
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you awake, son?" She spoke in a whisper that she might not disturb
      him if he were asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. "I haven't closed my eyes; it seems to me I have gone over my
      conversation with Miller a thousand times."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've give up tryin'," she told him, with a gratified little laugh. "I
      think I could, though, if your pa would 'a' kept still. He's in the
      kitchen now makin' him a cup o' strong coffee. He's been over them papers
      ever since you come up-stairs. Alan, I'm actually afeerd he couldn't stand
      it if that man didn't put up the money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would go hard with him," said Alan. "Has Uncle Ab gone to sleep?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; he's settin' in the door o' his room chawin' tobacco; he lays the
      blame on yore pa. I don't think I ever saw him so irritated before. But
      nobody ain't to blame but hisse'f. He's jest excited like the rest of us.
      I've seed 'im lie an' snore with a bigger noise goin' on around 'im 'an
      yore pa is a-makin'."

    <p>
      S Henry, Aunt Maria's husband, who was the chief farm-hand, was busy
      patching fences the next morning, Bishop sent over for Pole Baker to drive
      the spring-wagon. Alan sat beside Pole, and Abner and Bishop and Mrs.
      Bishop occupied the rear seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan knew he could trust Pole, drunk or sober, and he confided his plans
      to the flattered fellow's ears. Pole seemed to weigh all the chances for
      and against success in his mind as he sat listening, a most grave and
      portentous expression on his massive face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My opinion is the feller 'll be thar as shore as preachin'," he said.
      "But whether you git his wad or not, that's another question. Miller's as
      sharp as a briar, an', as he says, if Wilson gits to talkin' about that
      land to any o' these hill-Billies they 'll bu'st the trade or die tryin'.
      Jest let 'em heer money's about to change hands an' it 'll make 'em so
      durn jealous they 'll swear a lie to keep it away from anybody they know.
      That's human natur'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you are right," said Alan, pulling a long face; "and I'm afraid
      Wilson will want to make some inquiries before he closes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like as not," opined the driver; "but what I'd do, ef I was a-runnin' it,
      would be to git some feller to strike up with 'im accidental-like, an'
      liter'ly fill 'im to the neck with good things about the property without
      him ever dreamin' he was bein' worked."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two exchanged glances. Alan had never looked at the man so admiringly.
      At that moment he seemed a giant of shrewdness, as well as that of
      physical strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you are right, Pole," he said, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what I am, an', what's more, I'm the one that could do the
      fillin', without him ever knowin' I had a funnel in his mouth. If I can't
      do it, I 'll fill my hat with saft mud an' put it on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan smiled warmly. "I 'll mention it to Miller," he said. "Yes, you could
      do it, Pole&mdash;if any man on earth could."
    </p>
    <p>
      Driving up to Miller's office they found the door open, and the owner came
      out with a warm smile of greeting and aided Mrs. Bishop to alight. "Well,"
      he smiled, when they had taken seats in the office. "We have gained the
      first step towards victory. Wilson is at the hotel. I saw his name on the
      register this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder Bishops drew a breath of relief. The old man grounded his heavy
      walking-stick suddenly, as if it had slipped through his inert fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm trustin' you boys to pull me through," he said, with a shaky laugh.
      "I hain't never treated Alan right, an' I'm heer to confess it. I 'lowed I
      was the only one in our layout with any business sense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you are willing to accept the loan?" said Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Willin'? I reckon I am. I never slept one wink last night fer feer some
      'n' 'll interfere with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller reflected a moment and then said: "I am afraid of only one thing,
      and that is this: Not one man in a million will make a trade of this size
      without corroborating the statements made by the people he is dealing
      with. Wilson is at breakfast by this time, and after he is through he may
      decide to nose around a little before coming to me. I'm afraid to go after
      him; he would think I was over-anxious. The trouble is that he may run
      upon somebody from out in the mountains&mdash;there are a lot in town
      already&mdash;and get to talking. Just one word about your biting off more
      than you can chaw, Mr. Bishop, would make 'im balk like a mean mule. He
      thinks I'm favoring him now, but let him get the notion that you haven't
      been holding that land for at least a hundred thousand an' the thing would
      bu'st like a bubble."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan mentioned Pole Baker's proposition. Miller thought it over for a
      moment, his brow wrinkled, and then he said: "Good!&mdash;a good idea, but
      you must call Pole in and let me give him a few pointers. By George! he
      could keep Wilson away from dangerous people anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan went after Pole, and Miller took him into his consultation-room in
      the rear, where they remained for about fifteen minutes. When they came
      out Pole's face was very grave. "I won't forget a thing," he said to
      Miller. "I understand exactly what you want. When I git through with 'im
      he 'll want that land bad enough to pay anything fer it, an' he won't
      dream I'm in cahoot with you, nuther. I can manage that. I ain't no fool
      ef I do have fits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you remember my description of him?" asked Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bet I do&mdash;thick-set, about fifty, bald, red-faced, sharp, black
      eyes, iron gray hair, an' mighty nigh always with a cigar in his mouth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right," laughed Miller, "now do your work, and we won't forget
      you. By all means keep him away from meddlesome people."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Pole had left the office and Miller had resumed his revolving-chair
      Mrs. Bishop addressed him, looking straight into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see," she said, in a timid, hesitating way, and yet with a note
      of firmness dominating her tone&mdash;"I don't see why we have to go
      through all this trickery to make the trade. Ef the land is good security
      fer the money we needn't be afeerd of what the man will find out. Ef it
      ain' t good security I don't want his money as fer as I'm concerned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was jest thinkin' that, too," chimed in her husband, throwing a
      troubled glance all round. "I want money to help me out o' my scrape, but
      I don't want to trick no man, Yankee or what not, into toatin' my loads.
      As Betsy says, it seems to me if the land's wuth the money we needn't make
      such a great to-do. I'm afeerd I won't feel exactly right about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young men exchanged alarmed glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't understand," said Miller, lamely, but he seemed to be
      unprepared for views so heretical to financial dealings, and could not
      finish what he had started to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," said Alan, testily, "the land is worth all Wilson can make out of
      it with the aid of his capital and the railroad he proposes to lay here.
      Father, you have spent several years looking up the best timbered
      properties, and getting good titles to it, and to a big lumber company a
      body of timber like you hold is no small tiling. We don't want to cheat
      him, but we do want to keep him from trying to cheat us by getting the
      upper hand. Rayburn thinks if he finds out we are hard up he 'll try to
      squeeze us to the lowest notch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," sighed Mrs. Bishop, "I'm shore I never had no idea we'd resort to
      gittin' Pole Baker to tole anybody around like a hog after a yeer o' corn.
      I 'lowed we was going to make a open-and-shut trade that we could be proud
      of, an' stop folk's mouths about Alfred's foolish dealin' s. But," she
      looked at Abner, who stood in the doorway leading to the
      consultation-room, "I 'll do whatever brother Ab thinks is right. I never
      knowed 'im to take undue advantage of anybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      They all looked at Abner, who was smiling broadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I say git his money," he replied, with a short, impulsive laugh&mdash;"git
      his money, and then ef you find he's starvin', hand 'im back what you feel
      you don't need. I look on a thing like this sorter like I did on
      scramblin' fer the upper holt in war-times. I remember I shot straight at
      a feller that was climbin' up the enemy's breastworks on his all-fours. I
      said to myse'f, ef this ball strikes you right, old chap, 'fore you drap
      over the bank, yo're one less agin the Confederacy; ef it don't you kin
      pop away at me. I don't think I give 'im anything but a flesh-wound in the
      back&mdash;beca'se he jest sagged down a little an' crawled on&mdash;an'
      that's about the wust you could do fer Wilson. I believe he ort to hold
      the bag awhile. Alf's hung on to it till his fingers ache an' he's weak at
      the knees. I never did feel like thar was any harm in passin' a
      counterfeit bill that some other chap passed on me. Ef the government,
      with all its high-paid help, cayn't keep crooked shinplasters from slidin'
      under our noses, it ortn't to kick agin our lookin' out fer ourse'ves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't lose any sleep about the Southern Land and Timber Company,
      Mrs. Bishop," said Miller. "They will take care of themselves&mdash;in
      fact, we 'll have to keep our eyes peeled to watch them even if we get
      this loan. Wilson didn't come up here for his health."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mother's all right," said Alan, "and so is father, but they must not
      chip in with that sort of talk before Wilson."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no, you mustn't," said Miller. "In fact, I think you'd better let me
      and Alan do the talking. You see, if you sit perfectly quiet he 'll think
      you are reluctant about giving such big security for such a small amount
      of money, and he will trade faster."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm perfectly willin' to keep quiet," agreed the old man, who now
      seemed better satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole Baker left the office with long, swinging strides. There was an
      entrance to the Johnston House through a long corridor opening on the
      street, and into this Pole slouched. The hotel office was empty save for
      the clerk who stood behind the counter, looking over the letters in the
      pigeon-holed key-rack on the wall. There was a big gong overhead which was
      rung by pulling a cord. It was used for announcing meals and calling the
      porter. A big china bowl on the counter was filled with wooden
      tooth-picks, and there was a show-case containing cigars. Pole glanced
      about cautiously without being noticed by the clerk, and then withdrew
      into the corridor, where he stood for several minutes, listening.
      Presently the dining-room door opened and Wilson strolled out and walked
      up to the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort of cigars have you got?" he said to the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing better than ten, three for a quarter," was the respectful reply,
      as the clerk recognized the man who had asked for the best room in the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson thrust his fingers into his vest-pocket and drew out a cigar. "I
      guess I can make what I have last me," he said, transferring his glance to
      Pole Baker, who had shambled across the room and leaned heavily over the
      open register. "Want to buy any chickins&mdash;fine fryin' size?" he asked
      the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we are in the market," was the answer. "Where are they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't fetch 'em in to-day," said Pole, dryly. "I never do till I know
      what they are a-bringin'. You'd better make a bid on a dozen of 'em
      anyway. They are the finest ever raised on Upper Holly Creek, jest this
      side o' whar old man Bishop's lumber paradise begins."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole was looking out of the corner of his eye at the stranger, and saw his
      hand, which was in the act of striking a match, suddenly stay itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We don't bid on produce till we see it," said the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I reckon no harm was done by my axin'," said Pole, who felt the
      eyes of the stranger on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you live near here?" asked Wilson, with a smile half of apology at
      addressing a stranger, even of Pole's humble stamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No." Pole laughed and waved his hand towards the mountains in the west,
      which were plainly discernible in the clear morning light. "No, I'm a
      mountain shanghai. I reckon it's fifteen mile on a bee-line to my shack."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't you say you lived near old Mr. Bishop's place?" asked Wilson,
      moving towards the open door which led to the veranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know which place o' his'n you mean," said Pole when they were
      alone outside and Wilson had lighted his cigar. "That old scamp owns the
      whole o' creation out our way. Well, I 'll take that back, fer he don't
      own any land that hain't loaded down with trees, but he's got territory
      enough. Some thinks he's goin' to seceed from the United States an' elect
      himself President of his own country."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson laughed, and then he said: "Have you got a few minutes to spare?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon I have," said Pole, "ef you've got the mate to that cigar."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson laughed again as he fished the desired article from his pocket and
      gave it and a match to Pole. Then he leaned against the heavy railing of
      the banisters. "I may as well tell you," he said, "I'm a dealer in lumber
      myself, and I'd like to know what kind of timber you have out there."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole pulled at the cigar, thrust it well into the corner of his mouth with
      the fire end smoking very near his left eye, and looked thoughtful. "To
      tell you the truth, my friend," he said, "I railly believe you'd be
      wastin' time to go over thar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you think so." It was a vocal start on the part of Wilson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; the truth is, old man Bishop has simply raked into his dern
      clutch ever' acre o' fine timber out that away. Now ef you went east, over
      t'other side o' the mountains, you mought pick out some good timber; but
      as I said, old man Bishop's got it all in a bag out our way. Saw-mill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't run a saw-mill," said Wilson, with an avaricious sparkle in
      his eye. "I sometimes buy timbered lands for a speculation, that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole laughed. "I didn't see how you could be a saw-mill man an' smoke
      cigars like this an' wear them clothes. I never knowed a saw-mill man to
      make any money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose this Mr. Bishop is buying to sell again," said Wilson,
      tentatively. "People generally have some such idea when they put money
      into such property." Pole looked wise and thoughtful. "I don't know
      whether he is or not," he said. "But my opinion is that he 'll hold on to
      it till he's in the ground. He evidently thinks a good time's a-comin'!
      Thar was a feller out thar t'other day with money to throw at cats; he's
      been tryin' to honeyfuggle the old man into a trade, but I don't think he
      made a deal with 'im."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where was the man from?" Wilson spoke uneasily. "I don't railly know, but
      he ain't a-goin' to give up. He told Neil Fulmore at his store that he was
      goin' home to see his company an' write the old man a proposition that ud
      fetch 'im ef thar was any trade in 'im."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson pulled out his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you happen to know where Mr. Rayburn Miller's law office is?" he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; it's right round the corner. I know whar all the <i>white</i> men in
      this town do business, an' he's as white as they make 'em, an' as straight
      as a shingle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's an acquaintance of mine," said Wilson. "I thought I'd run in and see
      him before I leave."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's right round the corner, an' down the fust side street, towards the
      court-house. I 'ain't got nothin' to do; I 'll p'int it out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Wilson, and they went out of the house and down the
      street together, Pole puffing vigorously at his cigar in the brisk breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thar you are," said Pole, pointing to Miller's sign. "Good-day, sir; much
      obleeged fer this smoke," and with his head in the air Pole walked past
      the office without looking in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-morning," exclaimed Miller, as Wilson entered. "You are not an early
      riser like we are here in the country." He introduced Wilson all round,
      and then gave him a chair near his desk and facing him rather than the
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is the gentleman who owns the property, I believe," said Wilson,
      suavely, as he indicated Bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller nodded, and a look of cunning dawned in his clear eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I have just been explaining to Mr. and Mrs. Bishop that the mere
      signing of a paper such as will be necessary to secure the loan will not
      bind them at all in the handling of their property. You know how cautious
      older people are nowadays in regard to legal matters. Now, Alan here,
      their son, understands the matter thoroughly, and his mind is not at all
      disturbed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson fell into the preliminary trap. "Oh no; it's not a binding thing at
      all," he said. "The payment of the money back to us releases you&mdash;that
      is, of course," Wilson recovered himself, "if we make the loan."
    </p>
    <p>
      Several hearts in the room sank, but Miller's face did not alter in the
      slightest. "Oh, of course, if the loan is made," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson put his silk hat on the top of Miller's desk, and flicked the ashes
      from his cigar into a cuspidor. Then he looked at Mrs. Bishop suddenly&mdash;"Does
      the lady object to smoking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all," said the old lady&mdash;"not at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause as Wilson relighted his cigar and pulled at it in
      silence. A step sounded on the sidewalk and Trabue put his head in at the
      door. Miller could have sworn at him, but he smiled. "Good-morning,
      Squire," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see you are busy," said the intruder, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just a little, Squire. I 'll see you in a few minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, all right." The old lawyer moved on down the sidewalk, his hands in
      his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller brought up the subject again with easy adroitness. "I mentioned
      your proposition to my clients&mdash;the proposition that they allow you
      the refusal of the land at one hundred thousand, and they have finally
      come round to it. As I told them, they could not possibly market a thing
      like that as easily and for as good a price as a company regularly in the
      business. I may have been wrong in giving such advice, but it was the way
      I felt about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without realizing it, Wilson tripped in another hole dug by Miller's
      inventive mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They couldn't do half as well with it," the Boston man said. "In fact, no
      one could, as I told you, pay as much for the property as we can,
      considering the railroad we have to move somewhere, and our gigantic
      facilities for handling lumber in America and abroad. Still I think, and
      our directors think, a hundred thousand is a big price."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller laughed as if amused. "That's five dollars an acre, you know, but
      I'm not here to boom Mr. Bishop's timber-land. In fact, all this has grown
      out of my going down to Atlanta to borrow twenty-five thousand dollars on
      the property. I think I would have saved time if I hadn't run on you down
      there, Mr. Wilson."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson frowned and looked at his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are willing," said he, "to make the loan at five per cent, per annum
      on two conditions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, out with them," laughed Miller. "What are they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "First," said Wilson, slowly and methodically, "we want the refusal of the
      property at one hundred thousand dollars."
    </p>
    <p>
      A thrill of triumph passed over the silent group. Alan saw his father's
      face fill with sudden hope, and then it seemed to stand in abeyance as if
      doubt had already mastered it. Abner Daniel caught his beard in his stiff
      fingers and slowly slid them downward. Mrs. Bishop's bonnet hid her face,
      but her fingers were twitching excitedly as they toyed with the fringe of
      her shawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller's indifference was surprising. "For what length of time do you want
      the refusal of the property at that figure?" he asked, almost in a tone of
      contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson hung fire, his brow wrinkled thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Till it is decided positively," he got out finally, "whether we can get a
      charter and a right of way to the property."
    </p>
    <p>
      To those who were not following the details as closely as were Alan and
      Miller the reply of the latter fell discouragingly, even Abner Daniel
      glared in open horror of what he regarded as an unfavorable turn in the
      proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's entirely too indefinite to suit my clients," said the lawyer. "Do
      you suppose, Mr. Wilson, that they want to hang their property up on a
      hook like that? Why, if you didn't attend to pushing your road through&mdash;well,
      they would simply be in your hands, the Lord only knows how long."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But we intend to do all we can to shove it through," said Wilson, with a
      flush.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know that is not a business-like proposition, Mr. Wilson," said
      Miller, with a bland smile. "Why, it amounts to an option without any
      limit at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't know," said Wilson, lamely. "Mr. Bishop will be interested
      just as we are in getting a right of way through&mdash;in fact, it would
      insure us of his help. We can't buy a right of way; we can't afford it.
      The citizens through whose property the road runs must be persuaded to
      contribute the land for the purpose, and Mr. Bishop, of course, has
      influence up here with his neighbors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still he would be very imprudent," said Miller, "to option his property
      without any limit. Now here's what we are willing to do. As long as you
      hold Mr. Bishop's note for twenty-five thousand dollars unpaid, you shall
      have the refusal of the land at one hundred thousand dollars. Now take my
      advice"&mdash;Miller was smiling broadly&mdash;"let it stand at that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson reflected for a moment, and then he said: "All right; let that go.
      The other condition is this&mdash;and it need be only a verbal promise&mdash;that
      nothing be said about my company's making this loan nor our securing the
      refusal of the property."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will suit us," said Miller. "Mr. Bishop' doesn't care to have the
      public know his business. Of course, the mortgage will have to be recorded
      at the court-house, but that need not attract attention. I don't blame Mr.
      Bishop," went on Miller, in a half-confidential tone. "These people are
      the worst gossips you ever saw. If you meet any of them they will tell you
      that Mr. Bishop has bu'sted himself wide open by buying so much
      timber-land, but this loan will make him as solid as the Bank of England.
      The people don't understand his dealings, and they are trying to take it
      out on him by blasting his reputation for being one of the solidest men in
      his county."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's all, I believe," said Wilson, and Miller drew a blank sheet
      of legal-cap paper to him and began to write. Half an hour later the
      papers were signed and Miller carelessly handed Wilson's crisp pink check
      on a New York bank to Mr. Bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you are, Mr. Bishop," he said, with a smile; "you didn't want any
      one else to have a finger in that big pie of yours over there, but you
      needed money, and I 'll tell you as a friend that a hundred thousand cash
      down will be about as well as you can do with that land. It takes money,
      and lots of it, to make money, and Mr. Wilson's company can move the thing
      faster than you can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a fact," said Wilson, in a tone that betrayed self-gratification.
      "Now we must all pull together for the railroad." He rose and turned to
      Miller. "Will you come with me to record the paper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said Miller, and they both left together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop family were left alone, and the strain being lifted, they found
      themselves almost wholly exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it all over?" gasped the old woman, standing up and grasping her son's
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've got his money," Alan told her, with a glad smile, "and a fair
      chance for more."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pink check was fluttering in old Bishop's hand. Already the old
      self-willed look that brooked no interference with his personal affairs
      was returning to his wrinkled face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll go over to Craig's bank an' deposit it," he said to Alan. "It 'll
      take a day or two to collect it, but he'd let me check on it right now fer
      any reasonable amount."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe I'd ask him not to mention the deposit," suggested Alan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh! I reckon I've got sense enough to do that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you intended to pay off the mortgage on our farm the fust
      thing," ventured Mrs. Bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can' t do it till the note's due next January," said Bishop, shortly.
      "I agreed to keep the money a yeer, an' Martin Doe 'll make me hold to it.
      But what do you reckon I care as long as I've got some 'n' to meet it
      with?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bishop's face fell. "I'd feel better about it if it was cleer," she
      faltered. "But the Lord knows we ort to feel thankful to come out as we
      have. If it hadn't been fer Alan&mdash;Mr. Miller said that Alan&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ef you all hadn't made sech a eternal row," broke in Bishop, testily,
      "I'd 'a' had more timber-land than this. Colonel Barclay has as fine a
      strip as any I got, an' he's bantered me for a trade time an' agin."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner Daniel seldom sneered at anybody, no matter what the provocation
      was, but it seemed impossible for him to refrain from it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've been lookin' fer the last three months like a man that needed more
      land," he said. "Jest no furder back 'an last night you 'lowed ef you
      could git enough fer yore folly to raise the debt off'n yore farm you'd
      die happy, an' now yo' re a-frettin' beca'se you didn't buy up the sides
      o' the earth an' give nobody else a foothold. Le' me tell you the truth,
      even ef it <i>does</i> hurt a little. Ef Alan hadn't thought o' this heer
      railroad idea, you'd 'a' been the biggest human pancake that ever lay flat
      in its own grease."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hain't said nothin' to the contrary," admitted Bishop, who really took
      the reproof well. "Alan knows what I think about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Bishop and his wife went to Craig's bank, and a moment later Miller
      returned, rubbing his hands with satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We got through, and he's gone to catch his train," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It worked as smooth as goose-grease. I wonder what Pole Baker said to
      him, or if he saw him. I have an idea he did, from the way Wilson danced
      to our music."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heer's Pole now," said Abner, from the door. "Come in heer, you triflin'
      loafer, an' give an account o' yorese'f."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I seed 'im makin' fer the train," laughed Pole, "an' so I sneaked in to
      see what you-uns done. He walked like he owned the town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It went through like lightning, without a hitch or a bobble," Abner told
      him. "We was jest a-won-derin' what you shot into 'im."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hardly know," Pole sniggered. "I got to talkin' to 'im an' it looked to
      me like I was chippin' off tan-bark with the sharpest tool I ever handled.
      Every lick seemed to draw blood, an' he stood an' tuck it without a start
      or a shiver. I said to myse'f: 'Pole Baker, yo're nothin' but a rag-tag,
      bob-tail mountain Hoosier, an' he's a slick duck from up North, with a
      gold watch-chain an' a silk beaver, but he's a lappin' up what you say
      like a hungry kitten does a pan o' milk. Go it, old boy, an' ef you win,
      you 'll he'p the finest man out o' trouble&mdash;I mean Alan Bishop, by
      gum&mdash;that ever lived.' It seemed to me I was filled with the fire of
      heaven. I could 'a' been at it yet&mdash;fer I'd jest started&mdash;but he
      drawed his watch on me, an' made a shoot fer this office, me with 'im, fer
      feer some yokel would strike up with 'im. I mighty nigh shoved 'im in at
      the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did noble," said Miller, while Pole and Alan were silently clasping
      hands. "Now I told you we wouldn't forget you. Go down to Wimbley's and
      tell him to give you the best suit of clothes he's got, and to charge them
      to me 'n' Alan."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole drew himself up to his full height, and stared at the lawyer with
      flashing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn yore soul," he said; "don't you say a thing like that to me agin. I
      'll have you know I've got feelin' s as well as you or anybody else. I'd
      cut off this right arm an' never wince to do Alan Bishop a favor, but I
      'll be danged ef anybody kin look me over after I've done a <i>little</i>
      one an' pay me for it in store-clothes. I don't like that one bit, an' I
      ain't afeerd to say so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't mean any offence, Pole," apologized Miller, most humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you wouldn't 'a' said it to <i>some</i> men," growled Pole, "I know
      that. When I want pay fer a thing like that, I 'll jest go to that corner
      o' the street an' look down at that rock-pile, whar Alan found me one day
      an' paid me out jest to keep me from bein' the laughin'-stock o' this
      town."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan put his arm over his shoulder. "Rayburn didn't mean any harm," he
      said, gently. "You are both my friends, and we've had a big victory
      to-day; let's not have hard feelings."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole hung his head stubbornly and Miller extended his hand. Abner Daniel
      was an attentive listener, a half smile on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, Pole," he said, with a little laugh, "you run down to Wimbley's an'
      tell 'im not to wrop up that suit. I'm a-owin' him a bill, an' he kin jest
      credit the value of it on my account."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole laughed heartily and thrust his big hand into Miller's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Uncle Ab," he said, "you'd make a dog laugh."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe yo' re right," said Abner, significantly, and then they all
      roared at Pole's expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Alan received the following letter from Dolly Barclay:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>DEAR ALAN,&mdash;Rayburn Miller told me in confidence of your
      wonderful success yesterday, and I simply cried with joy. I knew&mdash;I
      felt that you would win, and this is, as he says, a glorious beginning. I
      am so proud of you, and I am so full of hope to-day. All our troubles will
      come out right some day, and now that I know you love me I can wait.
      Rayburn would not have confided so much to me, but he said, while he would
      not let me tell father anything about the prospective railroad, he wanted
      me to prevent him from selling his tract of land near yours. You know my
      father consults me about all his business, and he will not dispose of that
      property without my knowing of it. Oh, wouldn't it he a fine joke on him
      to have him profit by your good judgment.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan was at the little post-office in Filmore's store when he received the
      letter, and he folded it and restored it to its envelope with a heart
      filled with love and tenderness. As he walked home through the woods, it
      seemed to him that everything in nature was ministering to his boundless
      happiness. He felt as light as air as he strode along. "God bless her
      dear, dear little soul!" he said, fervently.

    <p>
      BOUT a week after this transaction Rayburn Miller went to Atlanta on
      business for one of his clients, and while there he incidentally called at
      the offices of the Southern Land and Timber Company, hoping to meet Wilson
      and learn something about his immediate plans in regard to the new
      railroad. But he was informed that the president of the company had just
      gone to New York, and would not be back for a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rayburn was waiting in the rotunda of the Kimball House for his train,
      which left at ten o' clock, when he ran across his friend, Captain Ralph
      Burton, of the Gate City Guards, a local military company.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to see you," said the young officer. "Did you run up for the ball?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What ball is that?" asked Miller. "I am at the first of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, we are giving one here in this house tonight," answered Burton, who
      was a handsome man of thirty-five, tall and erect, and appeared at his
      best in his close-fitting evening-suit and light overcoat. "Come up-stairs
      and I 'll introduce you to a lot of strangers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't," Rayburn told him. "I've got to leave at ten o' clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you've got a good hour yet," insisted the officer. "Come up on the
      next floor, where the orchestra is, anyway, and we can sit down and watch
      the crowd come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller complied, and they found seats on the spacious floor overlooking
      the thronged office. From where they sat they could look through several
      large drawing-rooms into the ballroom beyond. Already a considerable
      number of people had assembled, and many couples were walking about, even
      quite near to the two young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By George!" suddenly exclaimed Miller, as a couple passed them, "who is
      that stunning-looking blonde; she walks like a queen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?" asked Burton, looking in the wrong direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, there, with Charlie Penrose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that one," said Burton, trying to think, "I know as well as I know
      anything, but her name has slipped my memory. Why, she's visiting the
      Bishops on Peachtree Street&mdash;a Miss Bishop, that's it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adele, little Adele? Impossible!" cried Rayburn, "and I've been thinking
      of her as a child all these years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you know her?" said Captain Burton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her brother is a chum of mine," explained Miller. "I haven't seen her
      since she went to Virginia to school, five years ago. I never would have
      recognized her in the world. My Lord! she's simply regal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't had the pleasure of meeting her," said the Captain; "but I've
      heard lots about her from the boys who go to Bishop's. They say she's
      remarkably clever&mdash;recites, you know, and takes off the plantation
      negro to perfection. She's a great favorite with Major Middleton, who
      doesn't often take to the frying size. She has been a big drawing card out
      at Bishop's ever since she came. The boys say the house overflows every
      evening. Are you going to speak to her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I get a good chance," said Rayburn, his eyes on the couple as they
      disappeared in the ballroom. "I don't like to go in looking like this, but
      she'd want to hear from home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I see," said Burton. "Well, you'd better try it before the grand
      march sweeps everything before it."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Miller entered the ballroom, Penrose was giving Adele a seat behind a
      cluster of palms, near the grand piano, around which the German orchestra
      was grouped. He went straight to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't remember me, Miss Adele," he said, with a smile, "but I'm going
      to risk speaking to you, anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up from the bunch of flowers in her lap, and, in a startled,
      eager sort of way, began to study his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I do not," she said, flushing a little, and yet smiling agreeably.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I call that a good joke," Penrose broke in, with a laugh, as he
      greeted Miller with a familiar slap on the shoulder. "Why, Rayburn, on my
      word, she hasn't talked of anybody else for the last week, and here she&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are <i>not</i> Rayburn Miller!" Adele exclaimed, and she stood up to
      give him her hand. "Yes, I have been talking of you, and it seems to me I
      have a thousand things to say, and oh, so many thanks!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in this impulsive greeting that gave Miller a
      delectable thrill all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were such a little thing the last time I saw you," he said, almost
      tenderly. "I declare, you have changed&mdash;so, so remarkably."
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded to Penrose, who was excusing himself, and then she said to
      Miller, "Are you going to dance to-night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He explained that he was obliged to take the train which left in a few
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her face actually fall with disappointment. The very genuineness of
      the expression pleased him inexplicably. "Then I must hurry," she said.
      "Would you mind talking to me a little while?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing could possibly please me so much," said he. "Suppose we stroll
      around?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She took his arm and he led her back to the rotunda overlooking the
      office.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you are Rayburn Miller!" she said, looking at him wonderingly. "Do you
      know, I have pictured you in my mind many times since mother wrote me all
      about how you rescued us from ruin. Oh, Mr. Miller, I could not in a
      thousand years tell you how my heart filled with gratitude to you. My
      mother goes into the smallest details in her letters, and she described
      your every word and action during that transaction in your office. I could
      tell just where her eyes filled and her throat choked up by her quivering
      handwriting. I declare, I looked on you as a sort of king with unlimited
      power. If I were a man I'd rather use my brain to help suffering people
      than to be made President of the United States and be a mere figure-head.
      You must not think I am spoiled by all this glitter and parade down here.
      The truth is, I heartily despise it. I wanted to be at home so bad when I
      got that letter that I cried myself to sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must not forget that your brother conceived the plan," Miller
      protested, "and that I only&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes; I know Alan thought of it," she interrupted, "but without your
      experience and firmness it would have remained in his dear old brain till
      the Lord knows when. The idea of their being in debt was slowly killing my
      father and mother, and you came to their relief just when they were unable
      to bear it any longer. I'm so glad you thought of borrowing that money."
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then a young man, half a head shorter than Adele, came up hurriedly.
      "Oh, here you are," he exclaimed, in a gasp of relief. "I've been looking
      for you everywhere. This is mine, you know&mdash;the grand march. They are
      all ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      Adele smiled pleasantly. "I hope you 'll excuse me from it, Mr.
      Tedcastle," she said. "I've just met a friend from home; I want to talk
      with him, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Miss Bishop, I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I asked you to please excuse me, Mr. Tedcastle." Miller saw her face
      harden, as if from the sneer of contempt that passed over it. "I hope it
      will not be necessary for me to explain my reasons in detail until I have
      a little more time at my disposal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, certainly not, Miss Bishop," said the young man, red with anger, as
      he bowed himself away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's society coming to?" Adele asked Miller, with a nervous little
      laugh. "Does a lady have to get down on her knees and beg men, little
      jumping-jacks, like that one, to excuse her, and pet them into a
      good-humor when she has good reason to change her mind about an
      engagement? That's a sort of slavery I don't intend to enter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You served him right," said Miller, who had himself resented the young
      man's childish impetuosity, and felt like slapping him for his
      impertinence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adele shrugged her fine shoulders. "Let's not waste any more time talking
      about him," she said. "I was going to tell you how happy you made them
      all. When I read mother's description of their return home that night&mdash;how
      she went round looking at each object and touching it, that she might
      realize it was hers again; and how father sat up till past midnight
      talking incessantly about it; and all the droll things Uncle Abner said, I
      cried and laughed by turns. I longed to see you, to tell you how I felt
      about what you did, and yet, now that I'm with you, all I say seems
      utterly weak and&mdash;inadequate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems wonderfully nice to me," Miller declared. "I don't deserve
      anything, and yet&mdash;well, I like to hear you talk." He laughed.
      "Whether I deserve it or not, I could listen to you for a week on a
      stretch."
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, Rayburn Miller had never in all his varied social career become
      so suddenly and startlingly interested in any woman. It all seemed like a
      dream, and a most delicious one&mdash;the gay assemblage, the intermittent
      strains of the music, the touch of the stately creature on his arm, the
      perfume of her flowers, her hair, her eyes! He suddenly felt fearful of
      the passage of time, the leaving of his train, the approach of some one to
      claim her attention. He could not explain the spell she had thrown on him.
      Was it because she was his friend's sister, and so astoundingly pretty,
      frank, and sensible, or could it be that&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      His train of thought was broken by the approach of Miss Ida Bishop,
      Adele's cousin, a rather plain girl, who, with her scrawny neck and scant
      hair&mdash;which rebelled against being made much of&mdash;would have
      appeared to better advantage in a street costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Adele," she cried, reproachfully, "what <i>do</i> you mean? Do you
      know you have mortally offended Mr. Tedcastle? He had the march with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I asked him as a favor to excuse me from it," said Adele, simply. "I
      had just met Mr. Miller, who is to leave on an early train, and I wanted
      to talk to him about home. Have you been introduced? My cousin, Miss
      Bishop, Mr. Rayburn Miller."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bishop bowed indifferently, and looked as if she still saw no
      justification in the slight under question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm awfully sorry," she said, reprovingly. "Mr. Tedcastle has been as
      nice to you as he could be, and this is the way you show appreciation for
      it. I don't blame him for being mad, do you, Mr. Miller?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I'd be a prejudiced witness," he smiled, "benefiting as I am
      by the gentleman' s discomfiture; but, really, I can' t think that any
      circumstances could justify a man in pressing a lady to fill an engagement
      when she chooses not to do so for any reason of hers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew you'd say that," said Adele. "If anybody has a right to be
      offended it is I, for the way he has acted without waiting for my full
      explanation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that is a high and mighty course that will do better for novels than
      real life," disagreed Miss Ida Bishop. "The young men are badly spoiled
      here, and if we want attention we've got to humor them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They shall not be spoiled by me," declared Adele. "Why," shrugging her
      shoulders, contemptuously, "if I had to run after them and bind up their
      bruises every time they fell down, I'd not appreciate their attentions.
      Besides, Mr. Tedcastle and his whole ilk actually put me to sleep. What do
      they talk about? Driving, pet dogs, flowers, candies, theatre-parties, and
      silly bosh, generally. Last Sunday Senator Hare dined at uncle's, and
      after dinner he and I were having really a wholesome sort of talk, and I
      was respecting myself&mdash;well, a little like I am now&mdash;when in
      traped 'Teddy' with his hangers-on. Of course, I had to introduce them to
      the Senator, and I felt like a fool, for he knew they were my 'company,'
      and it was impossible to keep them quiet. They went on with their baby
      talk, just as if Senator Hare were being given an intellectual treat. Of
      course, there are <i>some</i> grown-up men in Atlanta, but they are driven
      to the clubs by the swarms of little fellows. There comes Major Middleton,
      one of the old rgime. He may ask me to dance with him. Now watch; if he
      does, I 'll answer him just as I did Mr. Tedcastle, and you shall see how
      differently he will treat it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major, a handsome man of powerful physique and a great shock of curly,
      iron-gray hair, approached Adele, and with a low bow held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm after the next dance, my dear," he said. "You are one of the very few
      who ever dance with me, and I don't want to go home without it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Adele smiled. "I'm very sorry, Major," she said; "but I hope you 'll
      excuse me this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that's all right, my dear <i>child</i>," he said. "No, don't explain.
      I know your reasons are all right. Go ahead and enjoy yourself in your own
      way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won my bet," Adele laughed. "Major, I knew so well what you would say
      that I bet on it," and then she explained the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tedcastle ought to be spanked," said the Major, in his high-keyed voice.
      "A girl who had not rather hear from home than spin around with him ought
      not to have a home. I'm going to mine rather early tonight. I came only to
      show the boys how to make my famous Kentucky punch."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Major and Miss Ida Bishop had gone and left them together, Adele
      looked over the railing at the big clock in the office. "We have only a
      few minutes longer&mdash;if you are to take that train," she said,
      regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never had as little interest in trains in my life," he said. And he
      meant it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in the trains on our new road?" she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are too far ahead to interfere with my comfort," he retorted. "This
      one is a steam nightmare."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I presume you really could not miss it?" Her long-lashed eyes were down.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated; the simple thought suggested by her thrilled him as he had
      never been thrilled before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because," she added, "it would be so nice to have you come out to-morrow
      afternoon to tea, about four."
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew out his watch and looked at it waveringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could send a night message," he said, finally. "I really don't want to
      go. Miss Adele, I don't want to go at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want you to either," she said, softly. "It seems almost as if we
      are quite old friends. Isn't that strange?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He restored his watch to his pocket. "I shall stay," he said, "and I shall
      call to-morrow afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one came for her a few minutes later, and he went down to the office
      and out into the street. He wanted to walk, to feel his body in action,
      keeping pace with his throbbing, bounding brain. His whole being was
      aflame with a fire which had never burned in him before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alan' s little sister!" he kept repeating to himself. "Little Adele&mdash;she's
      wonderful, wonderful! Perhaps she may be <i>the</i> woman. By George! she
      <i>is</i>&mdash;she <i>is!</i> A creature like that, with that soul full
      of appreciation for a man' s best efforts, would lift a fellow to the
      highest rung on the ladder of human effort. Alan's little sister! And the
      idiot never told me, never intimated that she was&mdash;a goddess."
    </p>
    <p>
      In his room at the hotel that night he slept little, his brain being so
      active with his new experience. He saw her the next afternoon alone, over
      a dainty tea-service of fragile china, in a Turkish corner in William
      Bishop's great, quiet, house, and then proposed driving her the next day
      to the Driving Club. He remained a week, seeing her, under some pretext or
      other, every day during that time. Sometimes it was to call with her on
      friends of hers. Once it was to attend a barbecue given by Captain Burton
      at a club-house in the country, and once he gave her and her cousin a
      luncheon at the Capitol City Club with a box at the matine afterwards. He
      told himself that he had never lived before, and that, somehow, he was
      just beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he mused, as he sat in his train homeward bound. "I can't tell Alan.
      I simply couldn't do it, after all the rubbish I have crammed into him.
      Then she's his sister. I couldn't talk to him about her&mdash;not now,
      anyway."

      M glad you got back." Rayburn's sister, Mrs. Lampson, said to him at
      breakfast the morning following his return on the midnight train. "We are
      having a glorious meeting at our church."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, is that so?" said the young man, sipping his coffee. "Who is
      conducting it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brother Maynell," answered Mrs. Lampson, enthusiastically, a tinge of
      color in her wan, thin face. "He's a travelling evangelist, who has been
      conducting revivals all over the South. It is really remarkable the
      interest he has stirred up. We are holding prayer-meetings morning and
      afternoon, though only the ladies meet in the afternoon. I conducted the
      meeting yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no; did you, really? Why, sis&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't begin to poke fun at me," said Mrs. Lamp-son. "I know I didn't do
      as well as some of the others, but I did the best I could, because I felt
      it was my duty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was not going to make fun," said Miller, soothingly; "but it seems
      mighty strange to think of you standing up before all the rest, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not such a very hard thing to do," said the lady, who was older
      than her brother by ten years. She had gray hairs at her temples, and
      looked generally as if she needed out-door exercise and some diversion to
      draw her out of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rayburn helped himself to the deliciously browned, fried chicken, in its
      bed of cream gravy, and a hot puffy biscuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how does Mr. Lapsley, the regular preacher, like this innovation?" he
      questioned. "I reckon you all pay the new man a fee for stirring things
      up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; we agreed to give him two hundred dollars, half of which goes to an
      orphan asylum he is building. Oh, I don't think brother Lapsley minds
      much, but of course it must affect him a little to see the great interest
      brother Maynell has roused, and I suppose some are mean enough to think he
      could have done the same, if he had tried."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it's clearly a case of a new broom," smiled Rayburn, buttering his
      biscuit. "Old Lap might get up there and groan and whine for a week and
      not touch a mourner with a ten-foot pole. The other chap knows his
      business, and part of his business is not to stay long enough to wear out
      his pet phrases or exhaust his rockets. I'm sorry for Lapsley; he's paid a
      regular salary, and is not good for any other sort of work, and this shows
      him up unfairly. In the long run, I believe he 'll get as many into the
      church as the other man, and they will be more apt to stick. Sister,
      that's the trouble with these tin-pan revivals. The biggest converts
      backslide. I reckon you are working over old material now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lampson frowned and her lip stiffened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like your tone in speaking of such things," she said. "Indeed,
      Rayburn, I have been deeply mortified in the last week by some remarks
      that have been made about you. I didn't intend to mention them, but you
      make me do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I knew they wouldn't let me rest," said Miller; "they never do in
      their annual shake-ups."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brother, you are looked on by nearly all religious workers in town as a
      dangerous young man&mdash;I mean dangerous to the boys who are just
      growing up, because they all regard you as a sort of standard to shape
      their conduct by. They see you going to balls and dances and playing
      cards, and they think it is smart and will not be interested in our
      meetings. They see that you live and seem to prosper under it, and they
      follow in your footsteps. I am afraid you don't realize the awful example
      you are setting. Brother May-nell has heard of you and asked me about you
      the other day. Some people think you have been in Atlanta all this time to
      avoid the meeting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't know it was going on," said Miller, testily. "I assure you I
      never run from a thing like that. The best thing to do is to add fuel to
      the fire&mdash;it burns out quicker."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you will go out to meeting, won't you?" insisted the sweet-voiced
      woman. "You won't have them all thinking you have no respect for the
      religion of our father and mother&mdash;will you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rayburn squirmed under this close fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall go occasionally when there is <i>preaching</i>," he said,
      reluctantly. "I would be out of place at one of the&mdash;the knock-down
      and drag-out shouting-bees." Then, seeing her look of horror at the words
      which had unthoughtedly glided from his lips, he strove to make amends.
      "Oh, sister, do&mdash;<i>do</i> be reasonable, and look at it from my
      point of view. I don't believe that's the way to serve God or beautify the
      world. I believe in being happy in one's own way, just so that you don't
      tread on the rights of other people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Mrs. Lampson, her eyes flashing, "you <i>are</i> treading on
      the rights of others. They are trying to save the souls of the rising
      generation in the community, and you and your social set use your
      influence in the other direction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what about the rights of my social set, if you want to call it by
      that name?" Miller retorted, warmly. "We have the right to enjoy ourselves
      in our way, just as you have in yours. We don't interfere&mdash;we never
      ask you to close up shop so we can have a dance or a picnic, but you do.
      If we dare give a party while some revivalist is filling his pockets in
      town the revivalist jumps on us publicly and holds us up as examples of
      headlong plungers into fiery ruin. There is not a bit of justice or human
      liberty in that, and you 'll never reach a certain element till you quit
      such a course. Last year one of the preachers in this town declared in the
      pulpit that a girl could not be pure and dance a round dance. It raised
      the very devil in the hearts of the young men, who knew he was a dirty
      liar, and they got up as many dances out of spite as they possibly could.
      In fact, some of them came near knocking the preacher down on the street.
      I am a conservative sort of fellow, but I secretly wished that somebody
      would slug that man in the jaw."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm really afraid you are worse than ever," sighed Mrs. Lampson. "I don't
      know what to do with you." She laughed good-naturedly as she rose and
      stood behind his chair, touching his head tenderly. "It really does make
      me rather mad," she confessed, "to hear them making you out such a bad
      stripe when I know what a wonderful man you really are for your age. I
      really believe some of them are jealous of your success and standing, but
      I do want you to be more religious." When Miller reached his office about
      ten o' clock and had opened the door he noticed that Craig's bank on the
      corner across the street was still closed. It was an unusual occurrence at
      that hour and it riveted Miller's attention. Few people were on the
      street, and none of them seemed to have noticed it. The church-bell in the
      next block was ringing for the revivalist's prayer-meeting, and Miller saw
      the merchants and lawyers hurrying by on their way to worship. Miller
      stood in his front door and bowed to them as they passed. Trabue hustled
      out of his office, pulling the door to with a jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prayer-meeting?" he asked, glancing at Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not to-day," answered Miller; "got some writing to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That preacher's a hummer," said the old lawyer. "I've never seen his
      equal. He'd 'a' made a bang-up criminal lawyer. Why, they say old Joe
      Murphy's converted&mdash;got out of his bed at midnight and went to Tim
      Slocum's house to get 'im to pray for 'im. He's denied thar was a God all
      his life till now. I say a preacher's worth two hundred to a town if it
      can do that sort of work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's certainly worth it to Slocum," said Miller, with a smile. "If I'd
      been denying there was a God as long as he has, I'd pay more than that to
      get rid of the habit. Slocum's able, and I think he ought to foot that
      preacher's bill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a tough customer, Miller," said Trabue, with a knowing laugh.
      "You'd better look out&mdash;May-nell's got an eye on you. He 'll call out
      yore name some o' these days, an' ask us to pray fer you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was just wondering if there's anything wrong with Craig," said Miller.
      "I see his door's not open."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I reckon not," said the old lawyer. "He's been taking part in the
      meeting. He may have overslept."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a grocery-store near Miller's office, and the proprietor came
      out on the sidewalk and joined the two men. His name was Barnett. He was a
      powerful man, who stood six feet five in his boots; he wore no coat, and
      his suspenders were soiled and knotted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see you-uns is watchin' Craig's door," he said. "I've had my eye on it
      ever since breakfast. I hardly know what to make of it. I went thar to buy
      some New York exchange to pay for a bill o' flour, but he wouldn't let me
      in. I know he's thar, for I seed 'im go in about an hour ago. I mighty
      nigh shook the door off'n the hinges. His clerk, that Western fellow,
      Win-ship, has gone off to visit his folks, an' I reckon maybe Craig's got
      all the book-keepin' to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he oughtn't to keep his doors closed at this time of day," remarked
      Miller. "A man who has other people's money in his charge can' t be too
      careful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's got some o' mine," said the grocer, "and Mary Ann Tarpley, my wife's
      sister, put two hundred thar day before yesterday. Oh, I reckon nothin' s
      wrong, though I do remember I heerd somebody say Craig bought cotton
      futures an' sometimes got skeerd up a little about meetin' his
      obligations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never heard that," said Rayburn Miller, raising his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I have, an' I've heerd the same o' Winship," said the grocer, "but
      I never let it go no furder. I ain't no hand to circulate ill reports agin
      a good member of the church."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller bit his lip and an unpleasant thrill passed over him as Trabue
      walked on. "Twenty-five thousand," he thought, "is no small amount. It
      would tempt five men out of ten if they were inclined to go wrong, and
      were in a tight."
    </p>
    <p>
      The grocer was looking at him steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bank thar, don't you?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller nodded: "But I happen to have no money there right now. I made a
      deposit at the other bank yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suspicious, heigh? Now jest a little, wasn't you?" The grocer now spoke
      with undisguised uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all," replied the lawyer. "I was doing some business for the other
      bank, and felt that I ought to favor them by my cash deposits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't think thar's anything the matter, do you?" asked the grocer,
      his face still hardening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think Craig is acting queerly&mdash;very queerly for a banker," was
      Miller's slow reply. "He has always been most particular to open up early
      and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello," cried out a cheery voice, that of the middle-aged proprietor of
      the Darley Flouring Mills, emerging from Barnett's store. "I see you
      fellows have your eye on Craig's front. If he was a drinking man we might
      suspicion he'd been on a tear last night, wouldn't we?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It looks damned shaky to me," retorted the grocer, growing more excited.
      "I'm goin' over there an' try that door again. A man 'at has my money
      can't attract the attention Craig has an' me say nothin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      The miller pulled his little turf of gray beard and winked at Rayburn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You been scarin' Barnett," he said, with a tentative inflection. "He's
      easily rattled. By-the-way, now that I think of it, it does seem to me I
      heard some of the Methodists talkin' about reproving Craig an' Winship for
      speculatin' in grain and cotton. I know they've been dabblin' in it, for
      Craig always got my market reports. He's been dealin' with a bucket-shop
      in Atlanta."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going over there," said Miller, abruptly, and he hurried across in
      the wake of the big grocer. The miller followed him. On the other side of
      the street several people were curiously watching the bank door, and when
      Barnett went to it and grasped the handle and began to shake it vigorously
      they crossed over to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's wrong?" said a dealer in fruits, a short, thick-set man with a
      florid face; but Barnett's only reply was another furious shaking of the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, man, what's got into you?" protested the fruit-dealer, in a rising
      tone of astonishment. "Do you intend to break that door down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will if that damned skunk don't open it an' give me my money," said
      Barnett, who was now red in the face and almost foaming at the mouth.
      "He's back in thar, an' he knows it's past openin' time. By gum! I know
      more 'n I'm goin' to tell right now."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was followed by another rattling of the door, and the grocer's
      enormous weight, like a battering-ram, was thrown against the heavy walnut
      shutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open up, I say&mdash;open up in thar!" yelled the grocer, in a voice
      hoarse with passion and suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dozen men were now grouped around the doorway. Barnett released the
      handle and stood facing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somethin' s rotten in Denmark," he panted. "Believe me or not, fellows, I
      know a thing or two. This bank's in a bad fix."
    </p>
    <p>
      A thrill of horror shot through Miller. The words had the ring of
      conviction. Alan Bishop's money was in bad hands if it was there at all.
      Suddenly he saw a white, trembling hand fumbling with the lower part of
      the close-drawn window-shade, as if some one were about to raise it; but
      the shade remained down, the interior still obscured. It struck Miller as
      being a sudden impulse, defeated by fear of violence. There was a pause.
      Then the storm broke again. About fifty men had assembled, all wild to
      know what was wrong. Miller elbowed his way to the door and stood on the
      step, slightly raised above the others, Barnett by his side. "Let me speak
      to him," he said, pacifically. Barnett yielded doggedly, and Rayburn put
      his lips to the crack between the two folding-doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Craig!" he called out&mdash;"Mr. Craig!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no reply, but Rayburn heard the rustling of paper on the inside
      near the crack against which his ear was pressed, and then the edge of a
      sheet of writing-paper was slowly shoved through. Rayburn grasped it,
      lifting it above a dozen outstretched hands. "Hold on!" he cried,
      authoritatively. "Til read it." The silence of the grave fell on the crowd
      as the young man began to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friends and citizens," the note ran, "Winship has absconded with every
      dollar in the vaults, except about two hundred dollars in my small safe.
      He has been gone two days, I thought on a visit to his kinfolks. I have
      just discovered the loss. I'm completely ruined, and am now trying to make
      out a report of my condition. Have mercy on an old man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rayburn's face was as white as that of a corpse. The paper dropped from
      his hand and he stepped down into the crowd. He was himself no loser, but
      the Bishops had lost their all. How could he break the news to them?
      Presently he began to hope faintly that old Bishop might, within the last
      week, have drawn out at least part of the money, but that hope was soon
      discarded, for he remembered that the old man was waiting to invest the
      greater part of the deposit in some Shoal Creek Cotton Mill stock which
      had been promised him in a few weeks. No, the hope was groundless. Alan,
      his father, Mrs. Bishop, and&mdash;Adele&mdash;Miller's heart sank down
      into the very ooze of despair. All that he had done for Adele's people,
      and which had roused her deepest, tenderest gratitude, was swept away.
      What would she think now?
    </p>
    <p>
      His train of thought was rudely broken by an oath from Barnett, who, with
      the rage of a madman, suddenly threw his shoulder against the door. There
      was a crash, a groan of bursting timber and breaking bolts, and the door
      flew open. For one instant Miller saw the ghastly face and cowering form
      of the old banker behind the wire-grating, and then, with a scream of
      terror, Craig ran into a room in the rear, and thence made his escape at a
      door opening on the side street. The mob filled the bank, and did not
      discover Craig's escape for a minute; then, with a howl of rage, it surged
      back into the street. Craig was ahead of them, running towards the church,
      where prayer-meeting-was being held, the tails of his long frock-coat
      flying behind him, his worn silk hat in his convulsive grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thar he goes!" yelled Barnett, and he led the mob after him, all running
      at the top of their speed without realizing why they were doing so. They
      gained on the fleeing banker, and Barnett could almost touch him when they
      reached the church. With a cry of fear, like that of a wild animal brought
      to bay, Craig sprang up the steps and ran into the church, crying and
      groaning for help.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dozen men and women and children were kneeling at the altar to get the
      benefit of the prayers of the ministers and the congregation, but they
      stood up in alarm, some of them with wet faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mob checked itself at the door, but the greater part of it crowded
      into the two aisles, a motley human mass, many of them without coats or
      hats. The travelling evangelist seemed shocked out of expression; but the
      pastor, Mr. Lapsley, who was an old Confederate soldier, and used to
      scenes of violence, stood calmly facing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's all this mean?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came here for protection," whined Craig, "to my own church and people.
      This mob wants to kill me&mdash;tear me limb from limb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what's wrong?" asked the preacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Winship," panted Craig, his white head hanging down as he stood touching
      the altar railing&mdash;"Win-ship's absconded with all the money in my
      vault. I'm ruined. These people want me to give up what I haven't got. Oh,
      God knows, I would refund every cent if I had it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall have our protection," said the minister, calmly. "They won't
      violate the sacredness of the house of God by raising a row. You are safe
      here, brother Craig. I'm sure all reasonable people will not blame you for
      the fault of another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe he's got my money," cried out Barnett, in a coarse, sullen
      voice, "and the money of some o' my women folks that's helpless, and he's
      got to turn it over. Oh, he's got money some'r's, I 'll bet on that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The law is your only recourse, Mr. Barnett," said the preacher, calmly.
      "Even now you are laying yourself liable to serious prosecution for
      threatening a man with bodily injury when you can't prove he's wilfully
      harmed you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The words told on the mob, many of them being only small depositors, and
      Barnett found himself without open support. He was silent. Rayburn Miller,
      who had come up behind the mob and was now in the church, went to Craig's
      side. Many thought he was proffering his legal services.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One word, Mr. Craig," he said, touching the quivering arm of the banker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you're no loser," said Craig, turning on him. "There was nothing to
      your credit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that," whispered Miller, "but as attorney for the Bishops, I have
      a right to ask if their money is safe." The eyes of the banker went to the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's gone&mdash;every cent of it!" he said. "It was their money that
      tempted Winship. He'd never seen such a large pile at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mean&mdash;" But Miller felt the utter futility of the question
      on his tongue and turned away. Outside he met Jeff Dukes, one of the town
      marshals, who had been running, and was very red in the face and out of
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that mob in thar?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and quiet now," said Miller. "Let them alone; the important thing is
      to put the police on Winship's track. Come back down-town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll have to git the particulars from Craig fust," said Dukes. "Are you
      loser?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but some of my clients are, and I'm ready to stand any expense to
      catch the thief."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I 'll see you in a minute, and we 'll heat all the wires out of
      town. I 'll see you in a minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      Farther down the street Miller met Dolly Barclay. She had come straight
      from her home, in an opposite direction from the bank, and had evidently
      not heard the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm on my way to prayer-meeting," she smiled. "I'm getting good to please
      the old folks, but&mdash;" She noticed his pale face. "What is the matter?
      Has anything&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Craig's bank has failed," Rayburn told her briefly. "He says Winship has
      absconded with all the cash in the vaults."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly stared aghast. "And you&mdash;you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had no money there," broke in Miller. "I was fortunate enough to
      escape."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Alan&mdash;Mr. Bishop?" She was studying his face and pondering his
      unwonted excitement. "Had they money there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller did not answer, but she would not be put aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me," she urged&mdash;"tell me that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I do, it's in absolute confidence," he said, with professional
      firmness. "No one must know&mdash;not a soul&mdash;that they were
      depositors, for much depends on it. If Wilson knew they were hard up he
      might drive them to the wall. They were not only depositors, but they lose
      every cent they have&mdash;twenty-five thousand dollars in a lump."
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her catch her breath, and her lips moved mutely, as if repeating
      the words he had just spoken. "Poor Alan!" he heard her say. "This is too,
      <i>too</i> much, after all he has gone through."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller touched his hat and started on, but she joined him, keeping by his
      side like a patient, pleading child. He marvelled over her strength and
      wonderful poise. "I am taking you out of your way, Miss Dolly," he said,
      gently, more gently than he had ever spoken to her before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only want to know if Alan has heard. Do&mdash;do tell me that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he's at home. I shall ride out as soon as I get the matter in the
      hands of the police."
    </p>
    <p>
      She put out her slender, shapely hand and touched his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell him," she said, in a low, uncertain voice, "that it has broken my
      heart. Tell him I love him more than I ever did, and that I shall stick to
      him always."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller turned and took off his hat, giving her his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I believe you will do it," he said. "He's a lucky dog, even if he <i>has</i>
      just struck the ceiling. I know him, and your message will soften the
      blow. But it's awful, simply awful! I can't now see how they can possibly
      get from under it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, tell him," said Dolly, with a little, soundless sob in her throat&mdash;"tell
      him what I told you."

    <p>
      HAT afternoon the breeze swerved round from the south, bringing vague
      threats About three o' clock Alan, his his mother and father were in the
      front yard, looking at the house, with a view to making some alterations
      that had been talked of for several years past.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never had my way in anything before," Mrs. Bishop was running on, in
      the pleased voice of a happy child, "and I'm glad you are goin' to let me
      this once. I want the new room to jut out on this side from the parlor,
      and have a bay-window, and we must cut a wide foldin'-door between the two
      rooms. Then the old veranda comes down and the new one must have a double
      floor, like Colonel Sprague's on the river, except ours will have round,
      white columns instead o' square, if they do cost a trifle more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She knows what she wants," said Bishop, with one of his infrequent
      smiles, "and I reckon we'd save a little to let her boss the job, ef she
      don't hender the carpenters by too much talk. I don't want 'em to put in a
      stick o' lumber that ain't the best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad she's going to have her way," said Alan. "She's wanted a better
      house for twenty years, and she deserves it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe in sech fine feathers," said Bishop, argumentatively.
      "I'd a leetle ruther wait till we see whether Wilson's a-goin' to put that
      road through&mdash;then we <i>could</i> afford to put on a dab or two o'
      style. I don't know but I'd move down to Atlanta an' live alongside o'
      Bill, an' wear a claw-hammer coat an' a dicky cravat fer a change."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you mought run fer the legislatur'," spoke up Abner Daniel, who had
      been an amused listener, "an' git up a law to pen up mad dogs at the
      dangerous part o' the yeer. Alf, I've always thought you'd be a' ornament
      to the giddy whirl down thar. William was ever' bit as green as you are
      when he fust struck the town. But he had the advantage o' growin' up an'
      sorter ripenin' with the place. It ud be hard on you at yore time o'
      life."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Alan called their attention to a horseman far down the
      road. "It looks like Ray Miller's mare," he remarked. "This is one of his
      busy days; he can' t be coming to fish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Railroad news," suggested Abner. "It's a pity you hain't connected by
      telegraph."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all now sure that it was Miller, and with no little curiosity
      they moved nearer the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By gum! he's been givin' his mare the lash," said Abner. "She's fairly
      kivered with froth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, young man," Alan called out, as Miller dismounted at a
      hitching-post just outside the fence and fastened his bridle-rein. "Glad
      to see you; come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller bowed and smiled as he opened the gate and came forward to shake
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are certainly glad you came, Mr. Miller," said Mrs. Bishop, with all
      her quaint cordiality. "Ever since that day in the office I've wanted a
      chance to show you how much we appreciate what you done fer us. Brother Ab
      will bear me out when I say we speak of it mighty nigh ever'day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller wore an inexpressible look of embarrassment, which he tried to lose
      in the act of shaking hands all round the group, but his platitudes fell
      to the ground. Abner, the closest observer among them, already had his
      brows drawn together as he pondered Miller's unwonted lack of ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bring any fishing-tackle?" asked Alan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I didn't," said the lawyer, jerking himself to that subject
      awkwardly. "The truth is, I only ran out for a little ride. I've got to
      get back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it <i>is</i> business, as brother Ab said," put in Mrs. Bishop,
      tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller lowered his eyes to the ground and then raised them to Alan's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's railroad business," said Abner, his voice vibrant with
      suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it's not favorable," said Alan, bravely. "I can see that by your
      looks."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller glanced at his mare, and lashed the leg of his top-boots with his
      riding-whip. "No, I have bad news, but it's not about the railroad. I
      could have written, but I thought I'd better come myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adele!" gasped Mrs. Bishop. "You have heard&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, she's well," said Miller. "It's about the money you put in Craig's
      bank."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about that?" burst from old Bishop's startled lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Craig claims Winship has absconded with all the cash. The bank has
      failed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Failed!" The word was a moan from Bishop, and for a moment no one spoke.
      A negro woman at the wash-place behind the house was using a batting-stick
      on some clothing, and the dull blows came to them distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so, Ray?" asked Alan, calm but pale to the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry to say it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can anything at all be done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've done everything possible already. We have been telegraphing the
      Atlanta police all morning about tracing Winship, but they don't seem much
      interested. They think he's had too big a start on us. You see, he's been
      gone two days and nights. Craig says he thought he was on a visit to
      relatives till he discovered the loss last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It simply spells ruin, old man," said Alan, grimly. "I can see that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller said nothing for a moment&mdash;then:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's just as bad as it could be, my boy," he said. "I see no reason to
      raise false hopes. There is a strong feeling against Craig, and no little
      suspicion, owing to the report that he has been speculating heavily, but
      he has thrown himself on the protection of his church, and even some of
      his fellow-members, who lose considerably, are standing by him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here old Bishop, with compressed lips, turned and walked unsteadily into
      the house. With head hanging low and eyes flashing strangely, his wife
      followed him. At the steps she paused, her sense of hospitality
      transcending her despair. "You must stay to early supper, anyway, Mr.
      Miller," she said. "You could ride back in the cool o' the evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, but I must hurry right back, Mrs. Bishop," Miller said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Dolly&mdash;does she know?" asked Alan, when his mother had
      disappeared and Abner had walked to the hitching-post, and stood as if
      thoughtfully inspecting Miller's mare. Miller told him of their
      conversation that morning, and Alan' s face grew tender and more resigned.
    </p>

      "She's a brick!" said Miller. "She's a woman I now believe in thoroughly&mdash;she
      and one other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then there <i>is</i> another?" asked Alan, almost cheerfully, as an
      effect of the good news that had accompanied the bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I see things somewhat differently of late," admitted Miller, in an
      evasive, non-committal tone. "Dolly Barclay opened my eyes, and when they
      were open I saw&mdash;well, the good qualities of some one else. I may
      tell you about her some day, but I shall not now. Get your horse and come
      to town with me. We must be ready for any emergency."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner Daniel came towards them. "I don't want to harm nobody's character,"
      he said; "but whar my own kin is concerned, I'm up an' wide awake. I don't
      know what you think, but I hain't got a speck o' faith in Craig hisse'f.
      He done me a low, sneakin' trick once that I ketched up with. He swore it
      was a mistake, but it wasn't. He's a bad egg&mdash;you mind what I say; he
      won't do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be as you say, Mr. Daniel," returned Miller, with a lawyer's
      reserve on a point unsubstantiated by evidence, "but even if he has the
      money hidden away, how are we to get it from him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd find a way," retorted Daniel, hotly, "so I would."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We 'll do all we can," said Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel strode into the house and Alan went after his horse. Miller stood
      at the gate, idly tapping his boot with his whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Mrs. Bishop!" he said, his eyes on the house; "how very much she
      resembled Adele just now, and she is bearing it just like the little girl
      would. I reckon they 'll write her the bad news. I wish I was there to&mdash;soften
      the blow. It will wring her heart."

      HAT evening after supper the family remained, till bedtime, in the big,
      bare-looking dining-room, the clean, polished floors of which gleamed in
      the light of a little fire in the big chimney. Bishop's chair was tilted
      back against the wall in a dark corner, and Mrs. Bishop sat knitting
      mechanically. Abner was reading&mdash;or trying to read&mdash;a weekly
      paper at the end of the dining-table, aided by a dimly burning glass-lamp.
      Aunt Maria had removed the dishes and, with no little splash and clatter,
      was washing them in the adjoining kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Abner laid down his paper and began to try to console them for
      their loss. Mrs. Bishop listened patiently, but Bishop sat in the very
      coma of despair, unconscious of what was going on around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alf," Abner called out, sharply, "don't you remember what a close-fisted
      scamp I used to be about the time you an' Betsy fust hitched together?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't," said the man addressed, almost with a growl at being roused
      from what could not have been pleasant reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember folks said you was the stingiest one in our family," struck in
      Mrs. Bishop, plaintively. "Law me! I hain't thought of it from that day to
      this. It seems powerful funny now to think of you havin' sech a
      reputation, but I railly believe you had it once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' I deserved it," Abner folded his paper, and rapped with it on the
      table. "You know, Betsy, our old daddy was as close as they make 'em; he
      had a rope tied to every copper he had, an' I growed up thinkin' it was
      the only safe course in life. I was too stingy to buy ginger-cake an'
      cider at camp-meetin' when I was dyin' fer it. I've walked round an' round
      a old nigger woman's stand twenty times with a dry throat an' my fingers
      on a slick dime, an' finally made tracks fer the nighest spring. I had my
      eyes opened to stinginess bein' ungodly by noticin' its effect on pa. He
      was a natural human bein' till a body tetched his pocket, an' then he was
      a rantin' devil. I got to thinkin' I'd be like 'im by inheritance ef I
      didn't call a halt, an' I begun tryin' in various ways to reform. I
      remember I lent money a little freer than I had, which wasn't sayin' much,
      fer thar was a time when I wouldn't 'a' sold a man a postage-stamp on a
      credit ef he'd 'a' left it stuck to the back o' my neck fer security.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I 'll tell you how I made my fust great big slide towards
      reformation. It tuck my breath away, an' lots o' my money; but I did it
      with my eyes open. I was jest a-thinkin' a minute ago that maybe ef I told
      you-uns about how little it hurt me to give it up you mought sleep better
      to-night over yore own shortage. Alf, are you listenin'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I heerd what you said," mumbled Bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner cleared his throat, struck at a moth with his paper, and continued:
      "Betsy, you remember our cousin, Jimmy Bartow? You never knowed 'im well,
      beca'se you an' Alf was livin' on Holly Creek about that time, an' he was
      down in our neighborhood. He never was wuth shucks, but he twisted his
      mustache an' greased his hair an' got 'im a wife as easy as fallin' off a
      log. He got to clerkin' fer old Joe Mason in his store at the cross-roads,
      and the sight o' so much change passin' through his fingers sort o' turned
      his brain. He tuck to drinking an' tryin' to dress his wife fine, an' one
      thing or other, that made folks talk. He was our double fust cousin, you
      know, an' we tuck a big interest in 'im on that account. After a while old
      Joe begun to miss little dribs o' cash now an' then, an' begun to keep tab
      on Jimmy, an' 'fore the young scamp knowed it, he was ketched up with as
      plain as day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old Joe made a calculation that Jimmy had done 'im, fust and last, to the
      tune of about five hundred dollars, an' told Jimmy to set down by the
      stove an' wait fer the sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jimmy knowed he could depend on the family pride, an' he sent fer all the
      kin fer miles around. It raised a awful rumpus, fer not one o' our stock
      an' generation had ever been jailed, an' the last one of us didn't want it
      to happen. I reckon we was afeerd ef it once broke out amongst us it
      mought become a epidemic. They galloped in on the'r hosses an' mules, an'
      huddled around Mason. They closed his doors, back an' front, an' patted
      'im on the back, an' talked about the'r trade an' influence, an' begged
      'im not to prefer charges; but old Joe stood as solid as a rock. He said a
      thief was a thief, ef you spelt it back'ards or for'ards, or ef he was
      akin to a king or a corn-fiel' nigger. He said it was, generally, the
      bigger the station the bigger the thief. Old Joe jest set at his stove an'
      chawed tobacco an' spit. Now an' then he'd stick his hands down in his
      pockets an' rip out a oath. Then Jimmy's young wife come with her little
      teensy baby, an' set down by Jimmy, skeerd mighty nigh out of 'er life.
      Looked like the baby was skeerd too, fer it never cried ur moved. Then the
      sheriff driv' up in his buggy an' come in clinkin' a pair o' handcuffs. He
      seed what they was all up to an' stood back to see who would win, Jimmy's
      kin or old Joe. All at once I tuck notice o' something that made me
      madder'n a wet hen. They all knowed I had money laid up, an' they begun to
      ax old Mason ef I'd put up the five hundred dollars would he call it off.
      I was actu'ly so mad I couldn't speak. Old Joe said he reckoned, seein'
      that they was all so turribly set back, that he'd do it ef I was willin'.
      The Old Nick got in me then as big as a side of a house, an' I give the
      layout about the toughest talk they ever had. It didn't faze 'em much, fer
      all they wanted was to git Jimmy free, an' so they tuck another tack. Ef
      they'd git up half amongst 'em all, would I throw in t'other half? That,
      ef anything, made me madder. I axed 'em what they tuck me fer&mdash;did I
      look like a durn fool? An' did they think beca'se they was sech fools I
      was one?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old Tommy Todd, Jimmy's own uncle, was thar, but he never had a word to
      say. He jest set an' smoked his pipe an' looked about, but he wouldn't
      open his mouth when they'd ax him a question. He was knowed to be sech a
      skinflint that nobody seemed to count on his help at all, an' he looked
      like he was duly thankful fer his reputation to hide behind in sech a
      pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then they lit into me, an' showed me up in a light I'd never appeared in
      before. They said I was the only man thar without a family to support, an'
      the only one thar with ready cash in the bank, an' that ef I'd let my own
      double fust cousin be jailed, I was a disgrace to 'em all. They'd not nod
      to me in the big road, an' ud use the'r influence agin my stayin' in the
      church an' eventually gittin' into the kingdom o' Heaven. I turned from
      man to devil right thar. I got up on the head of a tater-barrel behind the
      counter, an' made the blamedest speech that ever rolled from a mouth
      inspired by iniquity. I picked 'em out one by one an' tore off their
      shirts, an' chawed the buttons. The only one I let escape was old Tommy;
      he never give me a chance to hit him. Then I finally come down to the
      prisoner at the bar an' I larruped him. Ever' time I'd give a yell, Jimmy
      ud duck his head, an' his wife ud huddle closer over the baby like she was
      afeerd splinters ud git in its eyes. I made fun of 'em till I jest had to
      quit. Then they turned the'r backs on me an' begun to figure on doin'
      without my aid. It was mortgage this, an' borrow this, an' sell this hoss
      or wagon or mule or cow, an' a turrible wrangle. I seed they was gittin'
      down to business an' left 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I noticed old Tommy make his escape, an' go out an' unhitch his hoss, but
      he didn't mount. Looked like he 'lowed he was at least entitled to
      carryin' the news home, whether he he'ped or not. I went to the spring at
      the foot o' the rise an' set down. I didn't feel right. In fact, I felt
      meaner than I ever had in all my life, an' couldn't 'a' told why. Somehow
      I felt all at once ef they did git Jimmy out o' hock an' presented 'im to
      his wife an' baby without me a-chippin' in, I'd never be able to look at
      'em without remorse, an' I did think a lots o' Jimmy's wife an' baby. I
      set thar watchin' the store about as sorry as a proud sperit kin feel
      after a big rage. Fust I'd hope they'd git up the required amount, an'
      then I'd almost hope they wouldn't. Once I actually riz to go offer my
      share, but the feer that it ud be refused stopped me. On the whole, I
      think I was in the mud about as deep as Jimmy was in the mire, an' I
      hadn't tuck nobody's money nuther. All at once I begun to try to see some
      way out o' my predicament. They wouldn't let me chip in, but I wondered ef
      they'd let me pay it all. I believed they would, an' I was about to hurry
      in the store when I was balked by the thought that folks would say I was a
      born idiot to be payin' my lazy, triflin' kinfolks out o' the consequences
      o' the'r devilment; so I set down agin, an' had another wrastle. I seed
      old Tommy standin' by his hoss chawin' his ridin'-switch an' watchin' the
      door. All at once he looked mighty contemptible, an' it struck me that I
      wasn't actin' one bit better, so I ris an' plunged fer the door. Old Tommy
      ketched my arm as I was about to pass 'im an' said, 'What you goin' to do,
      Ab?' An' I said, 'Uncle Tommy, I'm a-goin' to pay that boy out ef they 'll
      let me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You don't say,' the old fellow grunted, lookin' mighty funny, an' he
      slid in the store after me. Somehow I wasn't afeerd o' nothin' with or
      without shape. I felt like I was walkin' on air in the brightest, saftest
      sunshine I ever felt. They was all huddled over Mason's desk still
      a-figurin' an' a-complainin' at the uneven division. Jimmy set thar with
      his head ducked an' his young wife was tryin' to fix some'n' about the
      baby. She looked like she'd been cryin.'I got up on my tater-barrel an'
      knocked on the wall with a axe-handle to attract the'r attention. Then I
      begun. I don't know what I said, or how it sounded, but I seed Jimmy raise
      his head an' look, an' his wife push back her poke-bonnet an' stare like
      I'd been raised from the grave. Along with my request to be allowed to
      foot the whole bill, I said I wanted to do it beca'se I believed I could
      show Jimmy an' his wife that I was doin' it out o' genuine regard fer 'em
      both, an' that I wanted 'em to take a hopeful new start an' not be
      depressed. Well, sir, it was like an avalanche. I never in all my life
      seed sech a knocked-out gang. Nobody wanted to talk. The sheriff looked
      like he was afeerd his handcuffs ud jingle, an' Jimmy bu'st out cryin'.
      His wife sobbed till you could 'a' heerd her to the spring. She sprung up
      an' fetched me her baby an' begged me to kiss it. With her big glad eyes,
      an' the tears in 'em, she looked nigher an angel than any human bein' I
      ever looked at. Jimmy went out the back way wipin' his eyes, an' I went to
      Mason's desk to write him a check fer the money. He come to my elbow an'
      looked troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I said it was five hundred dollars,'said he, 'but I was sorter averagin'
      the loss. I ain't a-goin' to run no risks in a matter like this. I'd feel
      better to call it four hundred. You see, Jimmy's been a sort o' standby
      with me, an' has fetched me lots o' trade. Make it four hundred and I 'll
      keep 'im. I don't believe he 'll ever git wrong agin.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Jimmy never did. He stayed thar for five yeer on a stretch, an' was
      the best clerk in the county. I was paid a thousandfold. I never met them
      two in my life that they didn't look jest like they thought I was all
      right, an' that made me feel like I was to some extent. Old Tommy, though,
      was the funniest thing about it. He bored me mighty nigh to death. He'd
      come to my cabin whar I was livin' at the time an' set by my fire an'
      smoke an' never say hardly a word. It looked like some 'n' was on his
      mind, an' he couldn't git it off. One night when he'd stayed longer 'n
      usual, I pinned 'im down an' axed 'im what was the matter. He got up quick
      an' said nothin' aileded 'im, but he stopped at the fence an' called me
      out. He was as white as a sheet an' quiverin' all over. Said he: 'I've got
      to have this over with, Ab. I may as well tell you an' be done with it.
      It's been botherin' the life out o' me, an' I 'll never git rid of it till
      it's done. I want to pay you half o' that money you spent on Jimmy. I had
      the cash that day, an' it 'ain't done me one bit o' good sence then. I 'll
      never sleep well till I go you halvers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I cayn't sell that to you, Uncle Tommy,' I said, laughin'. 'No, siree,
      you couldn't chip into that investment ef you doubled yore offer. I've
      found out what it is wuth. But,' said I, 'ef you've got two hundred that's
      burnin' a hole in yore pocket, ur conscience, an' want to yank it out, go
      give it to Jimmy's wife to he'p her educate that baby.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "It struck 'im betwixt the eyes, but he didn't say yes or no. He slid away
      in the moonlight, all bent over an' quiet. I never seed 'im agin fer a
      month, an' then I called 'im out of a crowd o' fellers at the court-house
      an' axed 'im what he'd done. He looked bothered a little, but he gave me a
      straight look like he wasn't ready to sneak out o' anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I thought it over,' said he, 'but I railly don't see no reason why I ort
      to help Jimmy's child any more 'n a whole passle o' others that have as
      much claim on me by blood; but somehow I do feel like goin' cahoot with
      you in what's already been done, an' I'm still ready to jine you, ef you
      are willin'.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't take his money, but it set me to thinkin'. When old Tommy died,
      ten years after that, they found he had six wool socks filled with gold
      an' silver coin under his house, an' nobody ever heerd o' his doin' any
      charity work. I wish now that I'd 'a' lifted that cash an' 'a' put it whar
      it would do good. If I had he'd 'a' had a taste o' some 'n' that never
      glorified his pallet."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Abner concluded, Mrs. Bishop went to the fire and pushed the chunks
      together into a heap in the fireplace. Bishop moved in his chair, but he
      said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember heerin' about that, brother Ab," Mrs. Bishop said, a
      reminiscent intonation in her voice. "Some folks wondered powerful over
      it. I don't believe money does a body much good jest to hold an' keep. As
      the Lord is my judge, I jest wanted that bank deposit fer Alan and Adele.
      I wanted it, an' I wanted it bad, but I cayn't believe it was a sin."
    </p>
    <p>
      Something like a groan escaped Bishop's lips as he lowered the front posts
      of his chair to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the use o' talkin' about it?" he said, impatiently. "What's the
      use o' anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and moved towards the door leading to his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alfred," Mrs. Bishop called to him, "are you goin' to bed without holdin'
      prayer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm goin' to omit it to-night," he said. "I don't feel well, one bit.
      Besides, I reckon each pusson kin pray in private according to the way
      they feel."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner stood up, and removing the lamp-chimney he lighted a candle by the
      flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tried to put a moral lesson in what I said just now," he smiled,
      mechanically, "but I missed fire. Alf's sufferin' is jest unselfishness
      puore an' undefiled; he wants to set his children up in the world. This
      green globe is a sight better 'n some folks thinks it is. You kin find a
      little speck o' goody in mighty nigh ever' chestnut."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so, brother Ab," said his sister; "but we are ruined now&mdash;ruined,
      ruined!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ef you will look at it that way," admitted Abner, reaching for his
      candle; "but thar's a place ahead whar thar never was a bank, or a dollar,
      or a railroad, an' it ain't fur ahead, nuther. Some folks say it begins
      heer in this life."

      S Abner Daniel leaned over the rail-fence in front of Pole Baker's
      log-cabin one balmy day, two weeks later, he saw evidences of the
      ex-moonshiner's thriftlessness combined with an inordinate love for his
      children. A little express-wagon, painted red, such as city children
      receive from their well-to-do parents on Christmas, was going to ruin
      under a cherry-tree which had been bent to the ground by a rope-swing
      fastened to one of its flexible boughs. The body of a mechanical
      speaking-doll lay near by, and the remains of a toy air-rifle. After a
      protracted spree Pole usually came home laden down with such
      peace-offerings to his family and conscience. His wife might go without a
      needed gown, and he a coat, but his children never without toys. Seeing
      Abner at the fence, Mrs. Baker came to the low door and stood bending her
      head to look out.

      "I heerd at home," said Abner, "that Pole was over thar axin' fer me. I've
      been away to my peach-orchard on the hill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he's been over thar twice," said the woman. "He's back of the house
      some'r's settin' a trap fer the children to ketch some birds in. I 'll
      blow the horn. When I blow twice he knows he's wanted right off."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took down a cow's-horn from a nail on the wall, and going to the door
      on the opposite side of the house she gave two long, ringing blasts, which
      set half a dozen dogs near by and some far off to barking mellowly. In a
      few minutes Pole appeared around the corner of the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, Uncle Ab," he said. "Won't you come in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, hain't time," smiled the old man. "I jest come over to see how much
      money you wanted to borrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want any o' yo'rn," said Pole, leaning over the fence, his
      unbuttoned shirt-sleeves allowing his brawny, bare arms to rest on the top
      rail. "I wanted to talk to you about Alan an' that bank bu'st-up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've been to town, I heer," said Abner, deeply interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, an' I've been with Alan an' Miller fer the last week tryin' to do
      some 'n', but we couldn't. They've been sendin' telegrams by the
      basketful, an' Jeff Dukes has trotted his legs off back an' forth, but
      nothin' hain't been done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say the' hain't?" Abner's voice quivered and fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; they both kept up the'r sperits purty well fer about ten days beca'se
      that dang Atlanta chief of police kept wirin' he was on a scent o'
      Winship; but day before yesterday they give in. We was a-settin' in
      Miller's office when the last message come from Atlanta. They said they'd
      been after the wrong man, an' that they'd give up. You ort to 'a' seed
      Alan's face. Miller tried to cheer 'im up, but it wasn't no go. Then who
      do you think come? Alan's sweetheart. She axed to see 'im, an' they talked
      awhile in the front room; then Miller come back an' said she'd axed to be
      introduced to me. Jest think of it! I went in and seed she'd been
      a-cryin'. She got up, by jinks! an' ketched my hand an' said she wanted to
      thank me beca'se I'd been sech a friend to Alan. Uncle Ab, I felt as mean
      as a egg-suckin' dog, beca'se thar was Alan flat o' his back, as the
      feller said, an' I hadn't turned a hand to he'p 'im. And thar she was, the
      gal he loves an' wants, an' his poverty standin' betwixt 'em. I couldn't
      say nothin', an' I reckon I looked more kinds of a damn fool than she ever
      seed on two legs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what did you do?" asked Abner, too much moved by Pole's graphic
      picture to speak with his usual lightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did I do? I made my bow an' slid. I made a bee-line fer Murray's bar
      an' put two down as fast as they could shovel 'em out. Then I tuck
      another, an' quit countin'. I begun to think I owned the shebang, an'
      broke several billiard-cues an' throwed the chalk around. Then Dukes come
      an' said he'd give me a chance to escape trial fer misconduct, ef I'd
      straddle my hoss an' make fer home. I agreed, but thar was one thing I had
      to do fust. I had promised Alan not to drink any more, an' so I didn't
      want to sneak away to hide it. I went to Miller's house, whar he's
      stayin', an' called 'im out. I told 'im I'd jest come fer no other reason
      'an to let 'im see me at my wust. I felt like it was the only manly way,
      after I'd broke faith with a friend as true as he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too bad!" sighed Abner. "I 'll bet it hurt Alan to see you in that fix."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he didn't complain," said Pole. "But he put his arm around me an'
      come as nigh cryin' as I ever seed a strong man. 'It's my fault, Pole,'
      ses he. 'I can see that.' Then him an' Miller both tried to git me to go
      up-stairs in that fine house an' go to bed an' sleep it off, but I
      wouldn't. I come on home an' got mad at Sally fer talkin' to me, an' come
      as nigh as peas hittin' 'er in the jaw. But that's over, Uncle Ab. What
      I'm in fer now is work. I ain't no fool. I'm on a still hunt, an' I jest
      want yore private opinion. I don't want you to commit yorese'f, unless you
      want to; but I'd go more on yore jedgment than any man' s in this county.
      I want to know ef you think old Craig is a honest man at heart. Now don't
      say you don't know, an' keep yore mouth shet; fer what I want to know, an'
      <i>all</i> I want to know, is how you feel about that one thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner hung his head down. His long thumb trembled as its nail went under a
      splinter on the rail and pried it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see what you are a-drivin' at," he said. "You jest want to feel shore
      o' yore ground." Abner began to chew the splinter and spit out the broken
      bits. He was silent, under Pole's anxious gaze, for a minute, and then he
      laughed dryly. "I reckon me 'n' you has about the same suspicions," he
      said. "That p'int's been worryin' me fer several days, an' I didn't let it
      end, thar nuther."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! you didn't?" exclaimed Baker. "You say you didn't, Uncle Ab?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I got so I couldn't lie down at night without the idea poppin' into
      my head that maybe Craig had made a tool of Winship fer some minor crime
      an' had hustled 'im out o' the country so he could gobble up what was in
      the bank an' pose as a injured man in the community."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Same heer, pine blank!" said Pole, eagerly. "What did you do, Uncle Ab?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I went to Darley an' attended his church last Sunday," replied the old
      man, a tense expression in his eyes. "I got a seat in the amen-corner,
      whar I could see him, an' all through preachin' I watched 'im like a hawk.
      He didn't look to me like a man who had bu'sted on wind alone. He had a
      fat, oily, pink look, an' when they axed 'im to lead in prayer it looked
      to me like he was talkin' more to the people 'an he was to God. I didn't
      like his whine, an' what he said didn't seem to come from the cellar. But
      I seed that he was makin' converts to his side as fast as a dog kin trot.
      The Presbyterians an' Baptists has been accusin' the Methodists o' packin'
      more bad eggs 'an they have, an' it looks like Craig's crowd's a-goin' to
      swear he's fresh whether he is or not. After meetin' was over I walked
      ahead of him an' his fine lady, who has made the mistake o' tryin' to
      kiver the whole business up with silk an' feathers, an' waited fer 'em
      nigh the'r gate. I told 'im I wanted a word with 'im, an' they axed me in
      the parlor. I smelt dinner, but they didn't mention it. I wasn't goin' to
      eat thar nohow. Well, I set in an' jest told Craig what had been troublin'
      me. I said the loss o' my folk's money was as bad as death, an' that
      thar'd been so much talk agin him, an' suspicion, that I had jest come to
      headquarters. Ef he had any money laid away, I was thar to tell 'im it
      never would do 'im any good, an' ef he didn't, I wanted to beg his pardon
      fer my evil thoughts, an' try to git the matter off'n my mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good God! did you railly tell 'im that, Uncle Ab?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, an' I had a deep-laid reason. I wanted to make 'im mad an' study
      'im. He did git mad. He was as red as a dewberry, an' quivered from head
      to foot. Thar's two kinds o' mad&mdash;the justified an' the unjustified.
      Make a good man rail mad by accusin' 'im, an' he 'll justify hisse'f or
      bu'st; but ef you make a bad un mad by accusin' 'im, he 'll delight in
      showin' you he's done wrong&mdash;ef it hurts you <i>an' he's safe</i>.
      Thar's right whar I landed Craig. He had the look, as plain as day, o'
      sayin', 'Yes, dang you, I did it, an' you cayn't he'p yorese'f!' His wife
      had gone in the back part o' the house, an' after a while I heerd her new
      shoes a-creakin' at the door betwixt the two rooms. Now a pair o' shoes
      don't walk up to a door squeakin' like mice an' then stop all of a sudden
      without reason. I knowed she was a-listenin', an' I determined she should
      not heer me say she was purty. I told 'im louder 'an ever that folks was
      a-talkin', an' a-talkin', an' that fetched her. She flung open the door
      an' faced me as mad as a turtle on its back. She showed her hand, too, an'
      I knowed she was in cahoot with 'im. She cussed me black an' blue fer a
      uncouth, meddlin' devil, an' what not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By gum!" said Pole, his big eyes expanding. "But you didn't gain much by
      that, did you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jest satisfied myself that Alan's money&mdash;or some of it&mdash;wasn't
      out o' creation, that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have my reasons fer believin' like you do," said Pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say you have."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole glanced furtively over his shoulder at his cabin to see that no one
      was within hearing, then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know Winship is old Fred Parson's nephew. Well, old Fred's always
      been a stanch friend to me. We moonshined it together two yeer, though he
      never knowed my chief hidin'-place. In fact, nobody knows about that spot,
      Uncle Ab, even now. Well, I had a talk with him an' axed his opinion about
      his nephew. He talks as straight as a shingle, an' he ain't no idiot. He
      says it's all bosh about Winship takin' away all that boodle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He does, does he?" Abner nodded, as if to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and he don't claim Winship ain't guilty, nuther; he jest holds that
      he was too small a dabbler in devilment. He thinks, as I do, that Craig
      run 'im off with threats of arrest an' picked that chance to bu'st. He
      thinks Winship's in a safe place an' never will be fetched back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner drew himself up straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you talked to Alan an' Miller on that line?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tried to," grunted Pole, in high disgust, "but Miller says it's no good
      to think of accusin' Craig. He says we can' t prove a thing on 'im, unless
      we ketch Winship. He says that sort of a steal is the easiest thing on
      earth, an' that it's done every day. But that's beca'se he was fetched up
      in the law," Pole finished. "We-uns out heer in the mountains kin fish up
      other ways o' fetchin' a scamp to time without standin' 'im up before a
      thick-headed jury, or lettin' 'im out on bond till he dies o' old age.
      You've got sense enough to know that, Uncle Ab."
    </p>
    <p>
      The slanting rays of the setting sun struck the old man in the face. There
      was a tinkle of cow-bells in the pasture below the cabin. The outlaw in
      Pole Baker was a thing Abner Daniel deplored; and yet, to-day it was a
      straw bobbing about on the troubled waters of the old man' s soul towards
      which, if he did not extend his hand, he looked interestedly. A grim
      expression stole into his face, drawing the merry lines down towards his
      chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't do nothin' foolhardy," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole Baker grunted in sheer derision. "I've done fool things whar thar
      wasn't a thing to be made by 'em. By gum! I'd do ten dozen fer jest a bare
      chance o' shakin' that wad o' cash in Alan Bishop's face, an' so would
      you, dern yore hide&mdash;so would you, Uncle Ab Daniel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner blinked at the red sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The boy's been bad treated," he said, evasively; "bad, bad, bad! It's
      squeezed life an' hope out o' him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you are a church-member, an' so <i>fur</i> in good-standin'," said
      Pole, "an' I ain't agoin' to pull you into no devilment; but ef I see any
      way&mdash;I say <i>ef</i> I see any way, I 'll come an' tell you the
      news."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't do nothin' foolhardy," said Abner, and turned to go. He paused
      a few paces away and said, "I wouldn't do nothin' foolhardy, Pole." He
      motioned towards the cabin. "You've got them in thar to look after."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole let him walk on a few paces, then he climbed over the fence and
      caught him up. He drew the piece of quartz containing the tiny nugget of
      gold from his pocket, which he had shown Abner and Dole on a former
      occasion. "You see that, Uncle Ab," he said. "That dirty rock is like
      friendship in general, but that little yaller lump is like my friendship
      fer Alan Bishop. It's the puore thing, solid an' heavy, an' won't lose
      color. You don't know when that boy done his first favor to me. It was
      away back when we was boys together. A feller at Treadwell's mill one day,
      behind my back, called me a bad name&mdash;a name no man will take or can.
      He used my mother's name, God bless her! as puore an' holy a woman as ever
      lived, to git back at me. He hadn't no sooner spoke it than Alan was at
      his throat like a wild-cat. The skunk was bigger 'n him, but Alan beat 'im
      till he was black all over. I never heerd about it till about two weeks
      after it happened an' the feller had moved out West. Alan wouldn't let
      nobody tell me. I axed 'im why he hadn't let me know. 'Beca'se,'ses he,
      'you'd 'a' killed 'im an' 'a' got into trouble, an' he wasn't wuth it.
      'That's what he said, Uncle Ab." Pole's big-jawed face was full of
      struggling emotion, his voice was husky, his eyes were filling. "That's
      why it's a-killin' me to see 'im robbed of all he's got&mdash;his pride,
      his ambition, an' the good woman that loves 'im. Huh! ef I jest <i>knowed</i>
      that pie-faced hypocrite had his money he wouldn't have it long."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't do nothin' foolhardy, Pole." Abner looked into the fellow's
      face, drew a long, trembling breath, and finished, "I wouldn't&mdash;but I
      'll be dumed ef I know what I'd do!"

      HE following morning Pole rose before daylight and rode to Darley. As he
      reached the place, the first rays of the sun were touching the
      slate-covered spire of the largest church in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to a public wagon-yard and hitched his horse to one of the long
      racks. A mountain family he knew slightly had camped in the yard, sleeping
      in their canvas-covered wagon, and were making coffee over a little fire.
      Pole wanted a cup of the beverage, but he passed on into a grocery-store
      across the street and bought a dime's worth of cheese and hard-tack
      crackers. This was his breakfast. He washed it down with a dipper of water
      from the street well, and sat around the store chatting with the clerk,
      who was sprinkling the floor, and sweeping and dusting the long room. The
      clerk was a red-headed young man with a short, bristling mustache, and a
      suit of clothes that was too large for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't Mr. Craig stay around Fincher's warehouse a good deal?" Pole asked,
      as the clerk rested for a moment on his broom near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mighty nigh all day long," was the reply; "him an' Fincher's some kin, I
      think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On his wife's side," said Pole. "I want to see Mr. Craig. I wonder ef he
      'll be down thar this mornin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Purty apt," said the clerk. "Fincher's his best friend sence his
      bu'st-up, an' they are mighty thick. I reckon he gits the cold-shoulder at
      a lots o' places."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't say!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' of course he wants somewhar to go besides home. In passing I've seed
      'im a-figurin' several times at Fincher's desk. They say he's got some
      notion o' workin' fer Fincher as his bookkeeper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he 'll have to make a livin' some way," said Pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk laughed significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ef it ain't already made," said he, with a smile. Pole stood up. "I don't
      think that's right," he said, coldly. "Me nur you, nur nobody, hain't got
      no right to hint at what we don't know nothin' about. Mr. Craig may 'a'
      lost ever' cent he had."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a pig's valise!" sneered the red-headed man. "I'd bet my hat he's got
      money&mdash;an' plenty of it, huh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I don't know nothin' about it," said Pole, still coldly. "An'
      what's more, Dunn, I ain't a-goin' about smirchin' any helpless man's
      character, nuther. Ef I knowed he had made by the bu'st I'd talk
      different, but I don't know it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I see which side you are on, Baker," laughed the clerk. "Folks are
      about equally divided. Half is fer 'im an' half agin. But mark my words,
      Craig will slide out o' this town some day, an' be heerd of after a while
      a-gittin' started agin some'r's else. That racket has been worked to death
      all over the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole carried the discussion no further. Half an hour passed. Customers
      were coming in from the wagon-yard and examining the wares on the counters
      and making slow purchases. The proprietor came in and let the clerk go to
      breakfast. Pole stood in the doorway, looking up the street in the
      direction of Craig's residence. Presently he saw the ex-banker coming from
      the post-office, reading his mail. Pole stepped back into the store and
      let him go by; then he went to the door again and saw Craig go into
      Fincher's warehouse at the end of the next block of straggling, wooden
      buildings. Pole sauntered down the sidewalk in that direction, passing the
      front door of the warehouse without looking in. The door at the side of
      the house had a long platform before it, and on it Fincher, the
      proprietor, was weighing bales of hay which were being unloaded from
      several wagons by the countrymen who were disposing of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, Mr. Fincher," Pole greeted him, familiarly. "Want any help
      unloadin'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, Baker," said Fincher, looking up from the blank-book in which he
      was recording the weights. "No, I reckon they can handle it all right."
      Fincher was a short, fat man, very bald, and with a round, laughing face.
      He had known Pole a long time and considered him a most amusing character.
      "How do you come on, Pole?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, about as common. I jest thought them fellers looked sorter
      light-weight."
    </p>
    <p>
      The men on the wagon laughed as they thumped a bale of hay on to the
      platform. "You'd better dry up," one of them said. "We 'll git the mayor
      to put you to work agin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he 'll have to be quicker about it than he was the last time," said
      Pole, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one laughed lustily from behind a tall stack of wheat in bags in the
      warehouse. It was Lawyer Trabue. He came round and picked up Fincher's
      daily paper, as he did every morning, and sat down and began to read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you are talkin'," he said. "Thar was more rest in that job, Pole,
      than any you ever undertook. They tell me you didn't crack a rock."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fincher laughed as he closed his book and struck Baker with it playfully.
      "Pole was too tired to do that job," he said. "He was born that way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, Mr. Trabue," retaliated Pole, "did you ever heer how I got the best
      o' Mr. Fincher in a chicken trade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think I ever did, Pole," laughed the lawyer, expectantly. "How
      was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, come off, don't go over that again," said Fincher, flushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was this away," said Pole, with a broad, wholesome grin. "My cousin,
      Bart Wilks, was runnin' the restaurant under the car-shed about two yeer
      ago. He was a new hand at the business, an' one day he had a awful rush.
      He got a telegram that a trainload o' passengers had missed connection at
      Chattanooga an' would have to eat with him. He was powerful rattled,
      runnin' round like a dog after its tail. He knowed he'd have to have a lot
      o' fryin' chickens, an' he couldn't leave the restaurant, so he axed me ef
      I'd take the money an' go out in town an' buy 'em fer 'im. I consented,
      an' struck Mr. Fincher, who was sellin' sech truck then. He 'lowed, you
      know, that I jest wanted one, or two at the outside, fer my own use, so
      when I seed a fine coop out in front an' axed the price of 'em he kinder
      drawed on his beerd till his mouth fell open, an' studied how he could
      make the most out o' me. After a while he said: 'Well, Pole, I 'll make
      'em ten cents apiece ef I pick 'em, an' fifteen ef you pick 'em.' I sorter
      skeerd the chickens around an' seed thar was two or three tiny ones hidin'
      under the big ones, an' I seed what he was up to, but I was ready fer 'im.
      'All right,' ses I, 'you pick 'em.' Thar was two or three loafers standin'
      round an' they all laughed at me when Mr. Fincher got down over the coop
      an' finally ketched one about the size of a robin an' hauled it out. 'Keep
      on a-pickin',' ses I, an' he made a grab fer one a little bigger an'
      handed it up to me. Then he stuck his hands down in his pockets, doin' his
      best to keep from laughin'. The gang yelled then, but I wasn't done. 'Keep
      on a-pickin',' ses I. An' he got down agin. An', sir, I got that coop at
      about four cents apiece less 'n he'd paid fer 'em. He tried to back, but
      the gang wouldn't let 'im. It was the cheapest lot o' chickens I ever
      seed. I turned the little ones out to fatten, an' made Wilks pay me the
      market-price all round fer the bunch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll be bound you made some 'n' out of it," said Trabue. "Fincher, did
      you ever heer how that scamp tuck in every merchant on this street about
      two yeer ago?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never heerd anything except his owin' 'em all," said Fincher, with a
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could put 'im in the penitentiary fer it," affirmed the lawyer. "You
      know about that time thar was a powerful rivalry goin' on among the
      storekeepers. They was movin' heaven an' earth to sell the'r big stocks.
      Well, one of the spryest in the lot, Joe Gaylord, noticed that Pole was
      powerful popular with mountain-folks, an' he made 'im a proposition,
      bindin' 'im down to secrecy. He proposed to give Pole ten per cent,
      commission on all the goods he'd he'p sell by bringin' customers in the
      store. Pole hesitated, beca'se, he said, they might find it out, an' Joe
      finally agreed that all Pole would have to do was to fetch 'em in, give
      the wink, an' him an' his clerks would do the rest. It worked mighty slick
      fer a while, but Pole noticed that very often the folks he'd fetch in
      wouldn't be pleased with the goods an' prices an' ud go trade some'r's
      else. Then what do you think the scamp did? He went to every store in town
      an' made a secret contract to git ten per cent, on all sales, an' he had
      the softest snap you ever heerd of. He'd simply hang onto a gang from the
      country, whether he knowed 'em or not, an' foller 'em around till they
      bought; then he'd walk up an' rake in his part."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I got left once," said Pole, laughing with the others. "One gang that I
      stuck to all day went over to Melton an' bought."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the merchants caught on after a while an' stopped him," said
      Trabue; "but he made good money while he was at it. They'd 'a' sent 'im up
      fer it, ef it hadn't been sech a good joke on 'em."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know about that," replied Pole, thoughtfully. "I was doin' all I
      agreed, an' ef they could afford to pay ten per cent, to anybody, they
      mought as well 'a' paid it to me. I drawed trade to the whole town. The
      cigars an' whiskey I give away amounted to a lots. I've set up many a
      night tellin' them moss-backs tales to make 'em laugh."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, ef you ever git into any trouble let me know," said Trabue, as he
      rose to go. "I 'll defend you at half price; you'd be a sight o' help to a
      lawyer. I 'll be hanged if I ever seed a better case 'an you made out in
      the mayor's court, an' you hadn't a thing to back it up with, nuther."
    </p>
    <p>
      The hay was unloaded and the wagons driven away. Fincher stood eying Pole
      with admiration. "It's a fact," he said. "You could 'a' made some 'n' out
      o' yorese'f, if you'd 'a' been educated, an' had a showin'." Pole jerked
      his thumb over his shoulder at Craig, who was standing in the front door,
      looking out into the street. "Everybody don't git a fair showin' in this
      world, Mr. Fincher," he said. "That man Craig hain't been treated right."
    </p>
    <p>
      The jovial expression died out of the merchant's face, and he leaned
      against the door-jamb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right thar," he said&mdash;"dead right. He's been mighty unlucky
      and bad treated."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole grasped the brim of his massive hat, and drew it from his shaggy
      head. "It makes me so all-fired mad sometimes, Mr. Fincher, to heer folks
      a-runnin' that man down, that I want to fight. I ain't no religious man
      myse'f, but I respect one, an' I've always put him down in my book as a
      good man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So 've I," said the merchant, and he looked towards the subject of their
      conversation and called out: "Craig, oh, Craig, come back heer a minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole put on his hat and stared at the ground. He made a gesture as if of
      protest, but refrained from speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's wanted?" Craig came down to them. He was smoking a cigar and wore
      a comfortable look, as if he had been fighting a hard but successful fight
      and now heard only random shots from a fleeing enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ain't a candidate fer office," laughed Fincher, "but nearly all men
      like to know they've got friends. This chap heer's been standin' up fer
      you. He says it makes him mad to hear folks talk agin you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's Baker!" exclaimed the ex-banker, shaking hands with Pole and
      beaming on him. "Well, I don't know a man I'd rather have for a friend,"
      he said, smoothly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole tossed his head, and looked straight into the speaker's eye. "I'm fer
      human justice, Mr. Craig," he said. "An' I don't think folks has treated
      you right. What man is thar that don't now an' then make mistakes, sir?
      You've always had means, an' I never was anything but a pore mountain-boy,
      but I've always looked on you as a good man, a law-abidin' man, an' I
      don't like to heer folks try to blame you fer what another man done. When
      you had plenty, I never come nigh you, beca'se I knowed you belonged to
      one life an' me another, but now you are flat o' yore back, sir, I'm yore
      friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      Craig's face beamed; he pulled his beard; his eyes danced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad there are men in the world like you, Baker," he said. "I say I'm
      glad, and I mean it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fincher had begun to look over the figures in his book, and walked to the
      front.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my friendship ain't wuth nothin'," said Pole. "I know that. I never
      was in the shape to he'p nobody, but I know when a man' s treated right or
      wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if you ever need assistance, and I can help you, don't fail to call
      on me," Craig spoke with a tone of sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole took a deep breath and lowered his voice, glancing cautiously into
      the house, as if fearful of being overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I <i>do</i> need advice, Mr. Craig," he said. "Not money, nor
      nothin' expensive, but I've laid awake night after night wishing 'at I
      could run on some man of experience that I could ax fer advice, an' that I
      could trust. Mr. Craig, I 'll be blamed ef I don't feel like tellin' you
      some 'n' that never has passed my lips."
    </p>
    <p>
      Craig stared in interested astonishment. "Well, you can trust me, Baker,"
      he said; "and if I can advise you, why, I 'll do it with pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a cotton compress near by, with its vast sheds and platforms,
      and Pole looked at it steadily. He thrust his hand into his pants pocket
      and kept it there for a full minute. Then he shook his head, drew out his
      hand, and said: "I reckon I won't bother you to-day, Mr. Craig. Some day I
      'll come in town an' tell you, but&mdash;" Pole looked at the sun. "I
      reckon I'd better be goin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold on," Craig caught Pole's arm. The exbanker was a natural man.
      Despite his recent troubles, he had his share of curiosity, and Pole's
      manner and words had roused it to unwonted activity. "Hold on," he said.
      "What's your hurry? I've got time to spare if you have."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole hung his head for a moment in silence, then he looked the old man in
      the face. "Mr. Craig," he began, in even a lower voice, "do you reckon
      thar's any gold in them mountains?" Pole nodded to the blue wave in the
      east.
    </p>
    <p>
      Craig was standing near a bale of cotton and he sat down on it, first
      parting the tails of his long, black coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know; there might be," he said, deeply interested, and yet trying
      to appear indifferent. "There is plenty of it in the same range further
      down about Dalonega."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole had his hand in the right pocket of his rough jean trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is thar anybody in this town that could tell a piece o' gold ef they seed
      it?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, a good many, I reckon," said Craig, a steely beam of excitement in
      his unsteady eye. "I can, myself. I spent two years in the gold-mines of
      California when I was a young man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't say! I never knowed that." Pole had really heard of that fact,
      but his face was straight. He had managed to throw into it a most
      wonderful blending of fear and over-cautiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes; I've had a good deal of experience in such things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't say!" Pole was looking towards the compress again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Craig laughed out suddenly, and put his hand on Pole's shoulder with a
      friendly, downward stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can trust me, Baker," he said, persuasively, "and it may be that I
      could be of assistance to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something like an actual tremor of agitation in Pole's rough
      hand as he drew his little nugget from its resting-place at the bottom of
      his pocket. With a deep, indrawn breath, he handed it to Craig. "Is that
      thar little lump gold or not?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Craig started visibly as his eyes fell on the piece of gold. But he took
      it indifferently, and examined it closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where did you run across that?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to know ef it's the puore thing," answered Pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Craig made another examination, obviously to decide on the method he would
      apply to a situation that claimed all his interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it is," he said; "in fact, I know it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole took it eagerly, thrust it back into his pocket, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Craig, I know whar thar's a vein o' that stuff twenty yards thick,
      runnin' clean through a mountain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do!" Craig actually paled under his suppressed excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; an' I kin buy it, lock, stock, and barrel, fer five hundred
      dollars&mdash;the feller that owns it ud jump at it like a duck on a
      June-bug. That's my secret, Mr. Craig. I hain't one dollar to my name, but
      from this day on I'm goin' to work hard an' save my money till I own that
      property. I'm a-goin' down to Atlanta next week, whar people don't know
      me, an' have a lump of it bigger 'n this examined, an' ef it's gold I 'll
      own the land sooner or later."
    </p>
    <p>
      Craig glanced to the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come back here," he said. Opening a door at the end of the warehouse, he
      led Pole into a more retired spot, where they would be free from possible
      interruption. Then, in a most persuasive voice, he continued: "Baker, you
      need a man of experience with you in this. Besides, if there is as much of&mdash;of
      that stuff as you say there is, you wouldn't be able to use all you could
      make out of it. Now, it might take you a long time to get up the money to
      buy the land, and there is no telling what might happen in the mean time.
      I'm in a close place, but I could raise five hundred dollars, or even a
      thousand. My friends still stick to me, you know. The truth is, Baker, I'd
      like the best in the world to be able to make money to pay back what some
      of my friends have lost through me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole hung his head. He seemed to be speaking half to himself and on the
      verge of a smile when he replied: "I'd like to see you pay back some of
      'em too, Mr. Craig."
    </p>
    <p>
      Craig laid his hand gently on Pole's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How about lettin' me see the place, Baker?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole hesitated, and then he met the ex-banker's look with the expression
      of a man who has resigned himself to a generous impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, some day when you are a-passin' my way, stop in, an' I 'll&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How far is it?" broke in Craig, pulling his beard with unsteady fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good fifteen miles from heer," said Pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Craig smiled. "Nothin' but an easy ride," he declared. "I've got a horse
      doin' nothing in the stable. What's to hinder us from going to-day&mdash;this
      morning&mdash;as soon as I can go by for my horse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't keer," said Pole, resignedly. "But could you manage to go without
      anybody knowin' whar you was bound fer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Easy enough," Craig laughed. He was really pleased with Pole's extreme
      cautiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you mought meet me out thar some'r's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good idea&mdash;a good idea, Baker."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know whar the Ducktown road crosses Holly Creek, at the foot o'
      Old Pine Mountain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As well as I know where my house is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole looked at the sun, shading his eyes with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could you be thar by eleven o'clock?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Easy enough, Baker."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I 'll meet you&mdash;I'm a-goin' to trust you, Mr. Craig, an' when
      you see the vein, ef you think thar's enough money in it fer two&mdash;but
      we can see about that later."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, Baker. I 'll be there. But say," as Pole was moving away, "you
      are a drinking man, and get a little off sometimes. You haven't said
      anything about this where anybody&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole laughed reassuringly. "I never have been drunk enough to do that, Mr.
      Craig, an', what's more, I never will be."

    <p>
      BOUT noon that day, as Pole Baker sat on a fallen tree near the road-side
      in the loneliest spot of that rugged country, his horse grazing behind
      him, he saw Craig coming up the gradual incline from the creek. Pole stood
      up and caught the bridle-rein of his horse and muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Pole Baker, durn yore hide, you've got brains&mdash;at least, some
      folks say you have&mdash;an' so has he. Ef you don't git the best of that
      scalawag yo' re done fer. You've put purty big things through; now put
      this un through or shet up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, heer you are," merrily cried out the ex-banker, as he came up. He
      was smiling expectantly. "Your secret's safe with me. I hain't met a soul
      that I know sence I left town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad you didn't, Mr. Craig," Pole said. "I don't want anybody
      a-meddlin' with my business." He pointed up the rather steep and rocky
      road that led gradually up the mountain. "We've got two or three mile
      furder to go. Have you had any dinner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I put a cold biscuit and a slice of ham in my pocket," said Craig. "It
      'll do me till supper."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole mounted and led the way up the unfrequented road.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may as well tell you, Mr. Craig, that I used to be a moonshiner in
      these mountains, an'&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord, I knew that, Baker. Who doesn't, I'd like to know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole's big-booted legs swung back and forth like pendulums from the flanks
      of his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was a-goin' to tell you that I had a hide-out, whar I kept stuff
      stored, that wasn't knowed by one livin' man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you must have had a slick place from all I've heerd," said Craig,
      still in his vast good-humor with himself and everybody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The best natur' ever built," said Pole; "an' what's more, it was in thar
      that I found the gold. I reckon it ud 'a' been diskivered long ago, ef it
      had 'a' been above ground."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it's in&mdash;a sort of cave?" ventured Craig.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's jest it; but I've got the mouth of it closed up so it ud fool even
      a bloodhound."
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later Pole drew rein in a most isolated spot, near a great
      yawning canon from which came a roaring sound of rushing water and
      clashing winds. The sky overhead was blue and cloudless; the air at that
      altitude was crisp and rarefied, and held the odor of spruce pine. With a
      laugh Pole dismounted. "What ef I was to tell you, Mr. Craig, that you was
      in ten yards o' my old den right now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Craig looked about in surprise. "I'd think you was makin' fun o' me&mdash;tenderfootin',
      as we used to say out West."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm givin' it to you straight," said Pole, pointing with his
      riding-switch. "Do you see that pile o' rocks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Craig nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right under them two flat ones is the mouth o' my den," said Pole. "Now
      let's hitch to that hemlock, an' I 'll show you the whole thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had fastened their horses to swinging limbs in a dense thicket
      of laurel and rhododendron bushes, they went to the pile of rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I toted mighty nigh all of 'em from higher up," Pole explained. "Some o'
      the biggest I rolled down from that cliff above."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see how you are going to get into your hole in the ground," said
      Craig, with a laugh of pleasant anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole picked up a big, smooth stick of hickory, shaped like a crowbar, and
      thrust the end of it under the largest rock. "Huh! I 'll show you in a
      jiffy."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an enormous stone weighing over three hundred pounds; but with his
      strong lever and knotted muscles the ex-moonshiner managed to slide it
      slowly to the right, disclosing a black hole about two feet square in the
      ragged stone. From this protruded into the light the ends of a crude
      ladder leading down about twenty-five feet to the bottom of the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ugh!" Craig shuddered, as he peered into the dank blackness. "You don't
      mean that we are to go down there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a crisis. Craig seemed to be swayed between two impulses&mdash;a
      desire to penetrate farther and an almost controlling premonition of
      coming danger. Pole met the situation with his usual originality and
      continued subtlety of procedure. With his big feet dangling in the hole he
      threw himself back and gave vent to a hearty, prolonged laugh that went
      ringing and echoing about among the cliffs and chasms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'lowed this ud make yore flesh crawl," he said. "Looks like the openin'
      to the bad place, don't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It certainly does," said Craig, somewhat reassured by Pole's levity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, it <i>ain' t</i> more 'n forty feet square," said Pole. "Wait till I
      run down an' make a light. I've got some fat pine torches down at the foot
      o' the ladder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I believe I <i>will</i> let you go first," said Craig, with an
      uneasy little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole went down the ladder, recklessly thumping his heels on the rungs. He
      was lost to sight from above, but in a moment Craig heard him strike a
      match, and saw the red, growing flame of a sputtering torch from which
      twisted a rope of smoke. When it was well ablaze, Pole called up the
      ladder: "Come on, now, an' watch whar you put yore feet. This end o' the
      ladder is solid as the rock o' Gibralty."
    </p>
    <p>
      The square of daylight above was cut off, and in a moment the ex-banker
      stood beside his guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now come down this way," said Pole, and with the torch held high he led
      the way into a part of the chamber where the rock overhead sloped, down
      lower. Here lay some old whiskey-barrels, two or three lager-beer kegs,
      and the iron hoops of several barrels that had been burned. There were
      several one-gallon jugs with corn-cob stoppers. Pole swept his hand over
      them with a laugh. "If you was a drinkin' man, I could treat you to a
      thimbleful or two left in them jugs," he said, almost apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't drink, Baker," Craig said. His premonition of danger seemed
      to have returned to him, and to be driven in by the dank coolness of the
      cavern, the evidence of past outlawry around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole heaped his pieces of pine against a rock, and added to them the
      chunks of some barrel-staves, which set up a lively popping sound like a
      tiny fusillade of artillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see that rock behind you, Mr. Craig?" asked Pole. "Well, set down on
      it. Before we go any furder, me'n you've got to have a understanding."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man stared hesitatingly for an instant, and then, after carefully
      feeling of the stone, he complied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought we already&mdash;but, of course," he said, haltingly, "I'm
      ready to agree to anything that 'll make you feel safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I kinder 'lowed you would,'' and to Craig's overwhelming astonishment
      Pole drew a revolver from his hip-pocket and looked at it, twirling the
      cylinder with a deft thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean, Baker&mdash;'' But Craig's words remained unborn in his
      bewildered brain. The rigor of death itself seemed to have beset his
      tongue. A cold sweat broke out on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean that I've tuck the trouble to fetch you heer fer a purpose, Mr.
      Craig, an' thar ain't any use in beatin' about the bush to git at it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Craig made another effort at utterance, but failed. Pole could hear his
      rapid breathing and see the terrified gleaming of his wide-open eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've had a lots o' dealin' s, Mr. Craig," said Pole. "You've made yore
      mistakes an' had yore good luck, but you never did a bigger fool thing 'an
      you did when you listened to my tale about that lump o' gold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've trapped me!" burst from Craig's quivering lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's about the size of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;why?" The words formed the beginning and the end of a gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole towered over him, the revolver in his tense hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Craig, thar is one man in this world that I'd die fer twenty times
      over. I love 'im more than a brother. That man you've robbed of every
      dollar an' hope on earth. I've fetched you heer to die a lingerin' death,
      ef&mdash;ef, I say, <i>ef</i>&mdash;you don't refund his money. That man
      is Alan Bishop, an' the amount is twenty-five thousand dollars to a cent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I haven't any money," moaned the crouching figure; "not a dollar that
      I kin lay my hands on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you are in a damn bad fix," said Pole. "Unless I git that amount o'
      money from you you 'll never smell a breath o' fresh air or see natural
      daylight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean to kill a helpless man?" The words were like a prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd bottle you up heer to die," said Pole Baker, firmly. "You've met me
      in this lonely spot, an' no man could lay yore end to me. In fact, all
      that know you would swear you'd run off from the folks you've defrauded.
      You see nothin' but that money o' Alan Bishop's kin possibly save you. You
      know that well enough, an' thar ain't a bit o' use palaverin' about it.
      I've fetched a pen an' ink an' paper, an' you've got to write me an order
      fer the money. If I have to go as fur off as Atlanta, I 'll take the fust
      train an' go after it. If I git the money, you git out, ef I don't you
      won't see me agin, nur nobody else till you face yore Maker."
    </p>
    <p>
      Craig bent over his knees and groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think I <i>have</i> money," he said, straightening up. "Oh, my God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <i>know</i> it," said Pole. "I don't think anything about it&mdash;I <i>know</i>
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He took out the pen and ink from his pants pocket and unfolded a sheet of
      paper. "Git to work," he said. "You needn't try to turn me, you damned old
      hog!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Craig raised a pair of wide-open, helpless eyes to the rigid face above
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my God!" he said, again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You let God alone an' git down to business," said Pole, taking a fresh
      hold on the handle of his weapon. "I'm not goin' to waste time with you.
      Either you git me Alan Bishop's money or you 'll die. Hurry up!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you keep faith with me&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, durn you, why wouldn't I?" A gleam of triumph flashed in the
      outlaw's eyes. Up to this moment he had been groping in experimental
      darkness. He now saw his way clearly and his voice rang with dawning
      triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ex-banker had taken the pen and Pole spread out the sheet of paper on
      his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What assurance have I?" stammered Craig, his face like a death-mask
      against the rock behind him. "You see, after you got the money, you might
      think it safer to leave me here, thinking that I would prosecute you. I
      wouldn't, as God is my judge, but you might be afraid&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not afraid o' nothin'," said Pole. "Old man, you couldn't handle me
      without puttin' yorese'f in jail fer the rest o' yore life. That order's
      a-goin' to be proof that you have money when you've swore publicly that
      you didn't. No; when I'm paid back Alan Bishop's money I 'll let you go. I
      don't want to kill a man fer jest tryin' to steal an' not makin' the
      riffle."
    </p>
    <p>
      The logic struck home. The warmth of hope diffused itself over the gaunt
      form. "Then I 'll write a note to my wife," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole reached for one of the torches and held it near the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm glad I won't have to go furder'n Darley," he said. "It 'll be
      better fer both of us. By ridin' peert I can let you out before sundown.
      You may git a late supper at Darley, but it's a sight better'n gittin'
      none heer an' no bed to speak of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm putting my life in your hands, Baker," said Craig, and with an
      unsteady hand he began to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold on thar," said Pole. "You 'll know the best way to write to her, but
      when the money's mentioned I want you to say the twenty-five thousand
      dollars deposited in the bank by the Bishops. You see I'm not goin' to
      tote no order fer money I hain't no right to. An' I 'll tell you another
      thing, old man, you needn't throw out no hint to her to have me arrested.
      As God is my final judge, ef I'm tuck up fer this, they 'll never make me
      tell whar you are. I'd wait until you'd pegged out, anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not setting any trap for you, Baker," whined Craig. "You've got the
      longest head of any man I ever knew. You've got me in your power, and all
      I can ask of you is my life. I've got Bishop's money hidden in my house. I
      am willing to restore it, if you will release me. I can write my wife a
      note that will cause her to give it to you. Isn't that fair?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all I want," said Pole; "an' I 'll say this to you, I 'll agree to
      use my influence with Alan Bishop not to handle you by law; but the best
      thing fer you an' yore family to do is to shake the dirt of Darley off'n
      yore feet an' seek fresh pastures. These 'round heer ain't as green, in
      one way, as some I've seed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Craig wrote the note and handed it up to Baker. Pole read it slowly, and
      then said: "You mought 'a' axed 'er to excuse bad writin' an' spellin',
      an' hopin' these few lines will find you enjoyin' the same blessin' s; but
      ef it gits the boodle that's all I want. Now you keep yore shirt on, an'
      don't git skeerd o' the darkness. It will be as black as pitch, an' you
      kin heer yore eyelids creak after I shet the front door, but I 'll be back&mdash;ef
      I find yore old lady hain't run off with a handsomer man an' tuck the swag
      with 'er. I'm glad you cautioned 'er agin axin' me questions."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole backed to the foot of the ladder, followed by Craig.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't leave me here, Baker," he said, imploringly. "Don't, for God's
      sake! I swear I 'll go with you and get you the money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't do that, Mr. Craig; but I 'll be back as shore as fate, ef I get
      that cash," promised Pole. "It all depends on that. I 'll keep my word, if
      you do yore'n."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to trust you," said the old man, with the pleading intonation
      of a cowed and frightened child.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had gotten out, Pole thrust his head into the opening again. "It
      'll be like you to come up heer an' try to move this rock," he called out,
      "but you mought as well not try it, fer I'm goin' to add about a dump-cart
      load o' rocks to it to keep the wolves from diggin' you out."

      AYBURN MILLER and Alan spent that day on the river trying to catch fish,
      but with no luck at all, returning empty-handed to the farm-house for a
      late dinner. They passed the afternoon at target-shooting on the lawn with
      rifles and revolvers, ending the day by a reckless ride on their horses
      across the fields, over fences and ditches, after the manner of
      fox-hunting, a sport not often indulged in in that part of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening as they sat in the big sitting-room, smoking after-supper
      cigars, accompanied by Abner Daniel, with his long, cane-stemmed pipe,
      Mrs. Bishop came into the room, in her quiet way, smoothing her apron with
      her delicate hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pole Baker's rid up an' hitched at the front gate," she said. "Did you
      send 'im to town fer anything, Alan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, mother," replied her son. "I reckon he's come to get more meat. Is
      father out there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think he's some'r's about the stable," said Mrs. Bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller laughed. "I guess Pole isn't the best pay in the world, is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father never weighs or keeps account of anything he gets," said Alan.
      "They both make a guess at it, when cotton is sold. Father calls it
      'lumping' the thing, and usually Pole gets the lump. But he's all right,
      and I wish we could do more for him. Father was really thinking about
      helping him in some substantial way when the crash came&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thar!" broke in Daniel, with a gurgling laugh, "I've won my bet. I bet to
      myse'f jest now that ten minutes wouldn't pass 'fore Craig an' his
      bu'st-up would be mentioned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have been at it, off and on, all day," said Miller, with a low laugh.
      "The truth is, it makes me madder than anything I ever encountered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know why?" asked Abner, seriously, just as Pole Baker came through
      the dining-room and leaned against the door-jamb facing them. "It's
      beca'se"&mdash;nodding a greeting to Pole along with the others&mdash;"it's
      beca'se you know in reason that he's got that money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I wouldn't say <i>that</i>," protested Miller, in the tone of a man
      of broad experience in worldly affairs. "I wouldn't say that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I would, an' do," said Abner, in the full tone of decision. "I <i>know</i>
      he's got it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yo' re wrong thar, Uncle Ab," said Pole, striding forward and
      sinking into a chair. "You've got as good jedgment as any man I ever run
      across. I thought like you do once. I'd 'a' tuck my oath that he had it
      about two hours by sun this evenin', but I kin swear he hain't a cent of
      it now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that, Pole?" Abner stared across the wide hearth at him
      fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He hain't got it, Uncle Ab." Pole was beginning to smile mysteriously.
      "He <i>did</i> have it, but he hain't got it now. I got it from 'im, blast
      his ugly pictur'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>You</i> got it?" gasped Daniel. "<i>You?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I made up my mind he had it, an' it deviled me so much that I
      determined to have it by hook or crook, ef it killed me, or put me in hock
      the rest o' my life." Pole rose and took a packet wrapped in brown paper
      from under his rough coat and laid it on the table near Alan. "God bless
      you, old boy," he said, "thar's yore money! It's all thar. I counted it.
      It's in fifties an' hundreds."
    </p>
    <p>
      Breathlessly, and with expanded eyes, Alan broke the string about the
      packet and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great God!" he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller sprang up and looked at the stack of bills, but said nothing.
      Abner, leaning forward, uttered a little, low laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You&mdash;you didn't kill 'im, did you, Pole, old boy&mdash;you didn't,
      did you?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't harm a hair of his head," said Pole. "All I wanted was Alan' s
      money, an' thar it is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," grunted Daniel, "I'm glad you spared his life. And I thank God you
      got the money."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller was now hurriedly running over the bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say you counted it, Baker?" he said, pale with pleased excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three times; fust when it was turned over to me, an' twice on the way out
      heer from town."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bishop had not spoken until now, standing in the shadows of the
      others as if bewildered by what seemed a mocking impossibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it our money&mdash;is it our'n?" she finally found voice to say. "Oh,
      is it, Pole?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, 'm," replied Pole. "It's yo'rn." He produced a crumpled piece of
      paper and handed it to Miller. "Heer's Craig's order on his wife fer it,
      an' in it he acknowledges it's the cash deposited by Mr. Bishop. He won't
      give me no trouble. I've got 'im fixed. He 'll leave Darley in the
      mornin'. He's afeerd this 'll git out an' he 'll be lynched."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan was profoundly moved. He transferred his gaze from the money to
      Pole's face, and leaned towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did it out of friendship for me," he said, his voice shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what I did it fer, Alan, an' I wish I could do it over agin. When
      I laid hold o' that wad an' knowed it was the thing you wanted more'n
      anything else, I felt like flyin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell us all about it, Baker," said Miller, wrapping up the stack of
      bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," said Pole, but Mrs. Bishop interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait fer Alfred," she said, her voice rising and cracking in delight.
      "Wait; I 'll run find 'im."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went out through the dining-room towards the stables, calling her
      husband at every step. "Alfred, oh, Alfred!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heer!" she heard him call out from one of the stables.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned over the fence opposite the closed door, behind which she had
      heard his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Alfred!" she called, "come out, quick! I've got news fer you&mdash;big,
      big news!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard him grumbling as he emptied some ears of corn into the trough of
      the stall containing Alan' s favorite horse, and then with a growl he
      emerged into the starlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That fool nigger only give Alan's hoss six ears o' corn," he fumed. "I
      know, beca'se I counted the cobs; the hoss had licked the trough clean,
      an' gnawed the ends o' the cobs. The idea o' starvin' my stock right
      before my&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Alfred, what <i>do</i> you think has happened?" his wife broke in.
      "We've got the bank money back! Pole Baker managed somehow to get it. He's
      goin' to tell about it now. Come on in!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop closed the door behind him; he fumbled with the chain and padlock
      for an instant, then he moved towards her, his lip hanging, his eyes
      protruding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll believe my part o' that when&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," she cried, opening the gate for him to pass through, "the money's
      thar in the house on the table; it's been counted. I say it's thar! Don't
      you believe it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man moved through the gate mechanically. He paused to fasten it
      with the iron ring over the two posts. But after that he seemed to lose
      the power of locomotion. He stood facing her, his features working.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll believe my part o' that cat-an'-bull story when I see&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, come in the house, then," she cried. "You kin lay yore hands on it
      an' count it. It's a awful big pile, an' nothin' less than fifty-dollar
      bills."
    </p>
    <p>
      Grasping his arm, she half dragged, half led him into the house. Entering
      the sitting-room, he strode to the table and, without a word, picked up
      the package and opened it. He made an effort to count the money, but his
      fingers seemed to have lost their cunning, and he gave it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all there," Miller assured him, "and it's your money. You needn't
      bother about that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop sat down in his place in the chimney corner, the packet on his
      knees, while Pole Baker, modestly, and not without touches of humor,
      recounted his experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The toughest job I had was managin' the woman," Pole laughed. "You kin
      always count on a woman to be contrary. I believe ef you was tryin' to git
      some women out of a burnin' house they'd want to have the'r way about it.
      She read the order an' got white about the gills an' screamed, low, so
      nobody wouldn't heer 'er, an' then wanted to ax questions. That's the
      female of it. She knowed in reason that Craig was dead fixed an' couldn't
      git out until she complied with the instructions, but she wanted to know
      all about it. I reckon she thought he wouldn't give full particulars&mdash;an'
      he won't, nuther. She wouldn't budge to git the money, an' time was
      a-passin'. I finally had a thought that fetched 'er. I told 'er Craig was
      confined in a place along with a barrel o' gunpowder; that a slow fuse was
      burnin' towards 'im, an' that he'd go sky-high at about sundown ef I
      didn't git thar an' kick out the fire. Then I told 'er she'd be arrested
      fer holdin' the money, an' that got 'er in a trot. She fetched it out
      purty quick, a-cryin' an' abusin' me by turns. As soon as the money left
      'er hands though, she begun to beg me to ride fast. I wanted to come heer
      fust; but I felt sorter sorry fer Craig, an' went an' let 'im out. He was
      the gladdest man to see me you ever looked at. He thought I was goin' to
      leave 'im thar. He looked like he wanted to hug me. He says Winship wasn't
      much to blame. They both got in deep water speculatin', an' Craig was
      tempted to cabbage on the twenty-five thousand dollars."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Pole had concluded, the group sat in silence for a long time. It
      looked as if Bishop wanted to openly thank Pole for what he had done, but
      he had never done such a thing in the presence of others, and he could not
      pull himself to it. He sat crouched up in his tilted chair as if burning
      up with the joy of his release.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence was broken by Abner Daniel, as he filled his pipe anew and
      stood over the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They say money's a cuss an' the root of all evil," he said, dryly. "But
      in this case it's give Pole Baker thar a chance to show what's in 'im. I'd
      'a' give the last cent I have to 'a' done what he did to-day. I grant you
      he used deception, but it was the fust-water sort that that Bible king
      resorted to when he made out he was goin' to divide that baby by cuttin'
      it in halves. He fetched out the good an' squelched the bad." Abner
      glanced at Pole, and gave one of his impulsive inward laughs. "My boy,
      when I reach t'other shore I expect to see whole strings o' sech
      law-breakers as you a-playin' leap-frog on the golden sands. You don't
      sing an' pray a whole lot, nur keep yore religion in sight, but when
      thar's work to be done you shuck off yore shirt an' do it like a wild-cat
      a-scratchin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      No one spoke after this outburst for several minutes, though the glances
      cast in his direction showed the embarrassed ex-moonshiner that one and
      all had sanctioned Abner Daniel's opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop leaned forward and looked at the clock, and seeing that it was
      nine, he put the money in a bureau-drawer and turned the key. Then he took
      down the big family Bible from its shelf and sat down near the lamp. They
      all knew what the action portended.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's another thing," smiled Abner Daniel, while his brother-in-law was
      searching for his place in the big Book. "Money may be a bad thing, a cuss
      an' a evil, an' what not, but Alf 'ain't felt like holdin' prayer sence
      the bad news come; an' now that he's got the scads once more the fust
      thing is an appeal to the Throne. Yes, it may be a bad thing, but
      sometimes it sets folks to singin' an' shoutin'. Ef I was a-runnin' of the
      universe, I believe I'd do a lots o' distributin' in low places. I'd
      scrape off a good many tops an' level up more. Accordin' to some, the
      Lord's busy watchin' birds fall to the ground. I reckon our hard times is
      due to them pesky English sparrows that's overrun ever'thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd better dry up, Uncle Ab," said Pole Baker. "That's the kind o' talk
      that made brother Dole jump on you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh! That's a fact," said Daniel; "but this is in the family."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Bishop began to read in his even, declamatory voice, and all the
      others looked steadily at the fire in the chimney, their faces lighted up
      by the flickering flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had risen from their knees after prayer, Pole looked at Abner
      with eyes from which shot beams of amusement. He seemed to enjoy nothing
      so much as hearing Abner's religious opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say this thing has set Mr. Bishop to prayin', Uncle Ab?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what," smiled Abner, who had never admired Baker so much before.
      "Ef I stay heer, an' they ever git that railroad through, I'm goin' to
      have me a pair o' knee-pads made."

    </div>
    <p>
      BOUT a week after the events recorded in the preceding chapter, old man
      Bishop, just at dusk one evening, rode up to Pole Baker's humble domicile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole was in the front yard making a fire of sticks, twigs, and chips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that fer?" the old man questioned, as he dismounted and hitched
      his horse to the worm fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To drive off mosquitoes," said Pole, wiping his eyes, which were red from
      the effects of the smoke. "I 'll never pass another night like the last un
      ef I kin he'p it. I 'lowed my hide was thick, but they bored fer oil all
      over me from dark till sun-up. I never 've tried smoke, but Hank Watts
      says it's ahead o' pennyr'yal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shucks!" grunted the planter, "you ain't workin' it right. A few rags
      burnin' in a pan nigh yore bed may drive 'em out, but a smoke out heer in
      the yard 'll jest drive 'em in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" said Pole, in high disgust. "Do you expect me to sleep sech hot
      weather as this is with a fire nigh my bed? The durn things may eat me
      raw, but I 'll be blamed ef I barbecue myse'f to please 'em."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Baker appeared in the cabin-door, holding two of the youngest
      children by their hands. "He won't take my advice, Mr. Bishop," she said.
      "I jest rub a little lamp-oil on my face an' hands an' they don't tetch
      me." Pole grunted and looked with laughing eyes at the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She axed me t'other night why I'd quit kissin' 'er," he said. "An' I told
      'er I didn't keer any more fer kerosene than the mosquitoes did."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Baker laughed pleasantly, as she brought out a chair for Bishop and
      invited him to sit down. He complied, twirling his riding-switch in his
      hand. From his position, almost on a level with the floor, he could see
      the interior of one of the rooms. It was almost bare of furniture. Two
      opposite corners were occupied by crude bedsteads; in the centre of the
      room was a cradle made from a soap-box on rockers sawn from rough poplar
      boards. It had the appearance of having been in use through several
      generations. Near it stood a spinning-wheel and a three-legged stool. The
      sharp steel spindle gleamed in the firelight from the big log and mud
      chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the news from town, Mr. Bishop?" Pole asked, awkwardly, for it
      struck him that Bishop had called to talk with him about some business and
      was reluctant to introduce it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothin' that interests any of us, I reckon, Pole," said the old man,
      "except I made that investment in Shoal Cotton Factory stock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's good," said Pole, in the tone of anybody but a man who had never
      invested a dollar in anything. "It's all hunkey, an' my opinion is that it
      'll never be wuth less."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did heer, too," added Bishop, "that it was reported that Craig had set
      up a little grocery store out in Texas, nigh the Indian Territory. Some
      thinks that Winship 'll turn up thar an' jine 'im, but a body never knows
      what to believe these days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That shore is a fact," opined Pole. "Sally, that corn-bread's a-burnin';
      ef you'd use less lamp-oil you'd smell better."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Baker darted to the fireplace, raked the live coals from beneath the
      cast-iron oven, and jerked off the lid in a cloud of steam and smoke. She
      turned over the pone with the aid of a case-knife, and then came back to
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fer the last month I've had my eye on the Bascome farm," Bishop was
      saying. "Thar's a hundred acres even, some good bottom land and upland,
      an' in the neighborhood o' thirty acres o' good wood. Then thar's a
      five-room house, well made an' tight, an' a barn, cow-house, an' stable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord! I know the place like a book," said Pole; "an' it's a dandy
      investment, Mr. Bishop. They say he offered it fer fifteen hundred. It's
      wuth two thousand. You won't drap any money by buyin' that property, Mr.
      Bishop. I'd hate to contract to build jest the house an' well an'
      out-houses fer a thousand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I bought it," Bishop told him. "He let me have it fer a good deal less 'n
      fifteen hundred, cash down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you made a dandy trade, Mr. Bishop. Ah, that's what ready money
      will do. When you got the cash things seem to come at bottom figures."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Bishop drew a folded paper from his pocket and slapped it on his knee.
      "Yes, I closed the deal this evenin', an' I was jest a-thinkin' that as
      you hain't rented fer next yeer&mdash;I mean&mdash;" Bishop was ordinarily
      direct of speech, but somehow his words became tangled, and he delivered
      himself awkwardly on this occasion. "You see, Alan thinks that you 'n
      Sally ort to live in a better house than jest this heer log-cabin, an'&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The wan face of the tired woman was aglow with expectation. She sank down
      on the doorstep, and sat still and mute, her hands clasping each other in
      her lap. She had always disliked that cabin and its sordid surroundings,
      and there was something in Bishop's talk that made her think he was about
      to propose renting the new farm, house and all, to her husband. Her mouth
      fell open; she scarcely allowed herself to breathe. Then, as Bishop
      paused, her husband's voice struck dumb dismay to her heart. It was as if
      she were falling from glowing hope back to tasted despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thar's more land in that farm an' I could do jestice to, Mr. Bishop; but
      ef thar's a good cabin on it an' you see fit to cut off enough fer me'n
      one hoss I'd jest as soon tend that as this heer. I want to do what you
      an' Alan think is best all'round."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Pole, Pole!" The woman was crying it to herself, her face lowered to
      her hands that the two men might not see the agony written in her eyes. A
      house like that to live in, with all those rooms and fireplaces, and
      windows with panes of glass in them! She fancied she saw her children
      playing on the tight, smooth floors and on the honeysuckled porch. For one
      minute these things had been hers, to be snatched away by the callous
      indifference of her husband, who, alas! had never cared a straw for
      appearances.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I wasn't thinking about <i>rentin'</i> it to you," said Bishop, and
      the woman's dream was over. She raised her head, awake again. "You see,"
      went on Bishop, still struggling for proper expression, "Alan thinks&mdash;well,
      he thinks you are sech a born fool about not acceptin' help from them that
      feels nigh to you, an' I may as well say grateful, exceedingly grateful,
      fer what you've done, things that no other livin' man could 'a' done. Alan
      thinks you ort to have the farm fer yore own property, an' so the deeds
      has been made out to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole drew himself up to his full height. His big face was flushed, half
      with anger, half with a strong emotion of a tenderer kind. He stood
      towering over the old man like a giant swayed by the warring winds of good
      and evil, "I won't heer a word more of that, Mr. Bishop," he said, with a
      quivering lip; "not a word more. By golly! I mean what I say. I don't want
      to heer another word of it. This heer place is good enough fer me an' my
      family. It's done eight yeer, an' it kin do another eight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Pole, Pole, <i>Pole!</i>" The woman's cry was now audible. It came
      straight from her pent-up, starving soul and went right to Bishop's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want the place, don't you, Sally?" he said, calling her by her given
      name for the first time, as if he had just discovered their kinship. He
      could not have used a tenderer tone to child of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mind, mind what you say, Sally!" ordered Pole, from the depths of his
      fighting emotions. "Mind what you say!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman looked at Bishop. Her glance was on fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I want it&mdash;I <i>want</i> it!" she cried. "I ain't goin' to lie.
      I want it more right now than I do the kingdom of heaven. I want it ef we
      have a right to it. Oh, I don't know." She dropped her head in her lap and
      began to sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop stood up. He moved towards her in a jerky fashion and laid his hand
      on the pitifully tight knot of hair at the back of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's yores," he said. "Alan thought Pole would raise a kick agin
      it, an' me'n him had it made out in yore name, so he couldn't tetch it.
      It's yores, Sally Ann Baker. That's the way it reads."
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman's sobs increased, but they were sobs of unbridled joy. With her
      apron to her eyes she rose and hurried into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the two men met. Bishop spoke first:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've got to give in, Pole," he said. "You'd not be a man to stand
      betwixt yore wife an' a thing she wants as bad as she does that place,
      an', by all that's good an' holy, you sha 'n' t."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the use o' me tryin' to git even with Alan," Pole exclaimed, "ef
      he's eternally a-goin' to git up some 'n'? I've been tickled to death ever
      since I cornered old Craig till now, but you an' him has sp'iled it all by
      this heer trick. It ain't fair to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's done," smiled the old man, as he went to his horse; "an' ef
      you don't live thar with Sally, I 'll make 'er git a divorce."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop had reached a little pig-pen in a fence-corner farther along, on
      his way home, when Mrs. Baker suddenly emerged from a patch of high corn
      in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he a-goin' to take it, Mr. Bishop?" she asked, panting from her
      hurried walk through the corn that hid her from the view of the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," Bishop told her; "I'm a-goin' to send two wagons over in the
      morning to move yore things. I wish it was ten times as good a place as it
      is, but it will insure you an' the children a living an' a comfortable
      home."
    </p>
    <p>
      After the manner of many of her kind, the woman uttered no words of
      thanks, but simply turned back into the corn, and, occupied with her own
      vision of prosperity and choking with gratitude, she hurried back to the
      cabin.

      HE summer ended, the autumn passed, 'and Christmas approached. Nothing of
      much importance had taken place among the characters of this little
      history. The Southern Land and Timber Company, and Wilson in particular,
      had disappointed Miller and Alan by their reticence in regard to the
      progress of the railroad scheme. At every meeting with Wilson they found
      him either really or pretendedly indifferent about the matter. His
      concern, he told them, was busy in other quarters, and that he really did
      not know what they would finally do about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He can' t pull the wool over my eyes," Miller told his friend, after one
      of these interviews. "He simply thinks he can freeze you out by holding
      off till you have to raise money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He may have inquired into my father's financial condition," suggested
      Alan, with a long face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most likely," replied the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And discovered exactly where we stand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps, but we must not believe that till we know it. I'm going to try
      to checkmate him. I don't know how, but I 'll think of something. He feels
      that he has the upper hand now, but I 'll interest him some of these
      days."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan's love affair had also been dragging. He had had numerous assurances
      of Dolly's constancy, but since learning how her father had acted the
      night he supposed she had eloped with Alan, her eyes had been opened to
      the seriousness of offending Colonel Barclay. She now knew that her
      marriage against his will would cause her immediate disinheritance, and
      she was too sensible a girl to want to go to Alan without a dollar and
      with the doors of her home closed against her. Besides, she believed in
      Alan' s future. She, somehow, had more faith in the railroad than any
      other interested person. She knew, too, that she was now more closely
      watched than formerly. She had, with firm finality, refused Frank
      Hillhouse's offer of marriage, and that had not helped her case in the
      eyes of her exasperated parent. Her mother occupied neutral ground; she
      had a vague liking for Alan Bishop, and, if the whole truth must be told,
      was heartily enjoying the situation. She was enjoying it so subtly and so
      heartily, in her own bloodless way, that she was at times almost afraid of
      its ending suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Christmas Eve Adele was expected home from Atlanta, and Alan had come
      in town to meet her. As it happened, an accident delayed her train so that
      it would not reach Darley till ten o' clock at night instead of six in the
      evening, so there was nothing for her brother to do but arrange for their
      staying that night at the Johnston House. Somewhat to Alan' s surprise,
      who had never discovered the close friendship and constant correspondence
      existing between Miller and his sister, the former announced that he was
      going to spend the night at the hotel and drive out to the farm with them
      the next morning. Of course, it was agreeable, Alan reflected, but it was
      a strange thing for Miller to propose.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the long veranda of the hotel after supper that evening the two
      friends witnessed the crude display of holiday fireworks in the street
      below. Half a dozen big bonfires made of dry-goods boxes, kerosene and tar
      barrels, and refuse of all kinds were blazing along the main street.
      Directly opposite the hotel the only confectionery and toy store in the
      place was crowded to overflowing by eager customers, and in front of it
      the purchasers of fireworks were letting them off for the benefit of the
      bystanders. Fire-crackers were exploded by the package, and every now and
      then a clerk in some store would come to the front door and fire off a gun
      or a revolver.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this noise and illumination was at its height when Adele's train drew
      up in the car-shed. The bonfires near at hand made it as light as day, and
      she had no trouble recognizing the two friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, what an awful racket!" she exclaimed, as she released herself from
      Alan' s embrace and gave her hand to Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's in your honor," Miller laughed, as, to Alan' s vast astonishment, he
      held on to her hand longer than seemed right. "We ought to have had the
      brass band out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm so glad to get home," said Adele, laying her hand on Miller's
      extended arm. Then she released it to give Alan her trunk-checks. "Get
      them, brother," she said. "Mr. Miller will take care of me. I suppose you
      are not going to drive home to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not if you are tired," said Miller, in a tone Alan had never heard his
      friend use to any woman, nor had he ever seen such an expression on
      Miller's face as lay there while the lawyer's eyes were feasting
      themselves on the girl's beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan hurried away after the trunks and a porter. He was almost blind with
      a rage that was new to him. Was Miller deliberately beginning a flirtation
      with Adele at a moment's notice? And had she been so spoiled by the "fast
      set" of Atlanta during her stay there that she would allow it&mdash;even
      if Miller was a friend of the family? He found a negro porter near the
      heap of luggage that had been hurled from the baggage-car, and ordered his
      sister's trunks taken to the hotel. Then he followed the couple moodily up
      to the hotel parlor. He was destined to undergo another shock, for, on
      entering that room, he surprised Miller and Adele on a sofa behind the big
      square piano with their heads suspiciously near together, and so deeply
      were they engaged in conversation that, although he drew up a chair near
      them, they paid no heed to him further than to recognize his appearance
      with a lifting of their eyes. They were talking of social affairs in
      Atlanta and people whose names were unfamiliar to Alan. He rose and stood
      before the fireplace, but they did not notice his change of position.
      Truly it was maddening. He told himself that Adele's pretty face and far
      too easy manner had attracted Miller's attention temporarily, and the
      fellow was daring to enter one of his flirtations right before his eyes.
      Alan would give him a piece of his mind at the first opportunity, even if
      he was under obligations to him. Indeed, Miller had greatly disappointed
      him, and so had Adele. He had always thought she, like Dolly Barclay, was
      different from other girls; but no, she was like them all. Miller's
      attention had simply turned her head. Well, as soon as he had a chance he
      would tell her a few things about Miller and his views of women. That
      would put her on her guard, but it would not draw out the poisoned sting
      left by Miller's presumption, or indelicacy, or whatever it was. Alan rose
      and stood at the fire unnoticed for several minutes, and then he showed
      that he was at least a good chaperon, for he reached out and drew on the
      old-fashioned bell-pull in the chimney-corner. The porter appeared, and
      Alan asked: "Is my sister's room ready?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's good and warm now, suh," said the negro. "I started the fire an
      hour ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller and Adele had paused to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you are going to hurry me off to bed," the girl said, with an audible
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must be tired after that ride," said Alan, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a fact, you must be," echoed Miller. "Well, if you have to go, you
      can finish telling me in the morning. You know I'm going to spend the
      night here, where I have a regular room, and I 'll see you at breakfast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm so glad," said Adele. "Yes, I can finish telling you in the
      morning." Then she seemed to notice her brother's long face, and she
      laughed out teasingly: "I 'll bet he and Dolly are no nearer together than
      ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right," Miller joined in her mood; "the Colonel still has his
      dogs ready for Alan, but they 'll make it up some day, I hope. Dolly is <i>next</i>
      to the smartest girl I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you <i>are</i> a flatterer," laughed Adele, and she gave Miller her
      hand. "Don't forget to be up for early breakfast. We must start soon in
      the morning. I'm dying to see the home folks."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan was glad that Miller had a room of his own, for he was not in a mood
      to converse with him; and when Adele had retired he refused Miller's
      proffered cigar and went to his own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller grunted as Alan turned away. "He's had bad news of some sort," he
      thought, "and it's about Dolly Barclay. I wonder, after all, if she would
      stick to a poor man. I begin to think some women would. Adele is of that
      stripe&mdash;yes, she is, and isn't she stunning-looking? She's a gem of
      the first water, straight as a die, full of pluck and&mdash;she's all
      right&mdash;all right!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out on the veranda to smoke and enjoy repeating these things over
      to himself. The bonfires in the street were dying down to red embers,
      around which stood a few stragglers; but there was a blaze of new light
      over the young man' s head. Along his horizon had dawned a glorious reason
      for his existence; a reason that discounted every reason he had ever
      entertained. "Adele, Adele," he said to himself, and then his cigar went
      out. Perhaps, his thoughts ran on in their mad race with happiness&mdash;perhaps,
      with her fair head on her pillow, she was thinking of him as he was of
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the corner came a crowd of young men singing negro songs. They
      passed under the veranda, and Miller recognized Frank Hillhouse's voice.
      "That you, Frank?" Miller called out, leaning over the railing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;that you, Ray?" Hillhouse stepped out into view. "Come on; we
      are going to turn the town over. Every sign comes down, according to
      custom, you know. Old Thad Moore is drunk in the calaboose. They put him
      in late this evening. We are going to mask and let him out. It's a dandy
      racket; we are going to make him think we are White Caps, and then set him
      down in the bosom of his family. Come on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't to-night," declined Miller, with a laugh. "I'm dead tired."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if you hear all the church bells ringing, you needn't think it's
      fire, and jump out of your skin. We ain't going to sleep to-night, and we
      don't intend to let anybody else do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, go it while you are young," Miller retorted, with a laugh, and
      Hillhouse joined his companions in mischief and they passed on singing
      merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller threw his cigar away and went to his room. He was ecstatically
      happy. The mere thought that Adele Bishop was under the same roof with
      him, and on the morrow was going to people who liked him, and leaned on
      his advice and experience, gave him a sweet content that thrilled him from
      head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I ought to tell Alan," he mused, "but he 'll find it out soon
      enough; and, hang it all, I can' t tell him how I feel about his own
      sister, after all the rot I've stuffed into him."

    <p>
      HE next morning, as soon as he was up, Alan went to his sister's room. He
      found her dressed and ready for him. She was seated before a cheerful
      grate-fire, looking over a magazine she had brought to pass the time on
      the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in," she said, pleasantly enough, he reflected, now that Miller was
      not present to absorb her attention. "I expected you to get up a little
      earlier. Those guns down at the bar-room just about daybreak waked me, and
      I couldn't go to sleep again. There is no use denying it, Al, we have a
      barbarous way of amusing ourselves up here in North Georgia."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went in and stood with his back to the fire, still unable to rid his
      brow of the frown it had worn the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I reckon you've got too citified for us," he said, "along with other
      accomplishments that fast set down there has taught you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Adele laid her book open on her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, Alan," she said, quite gravely. "What's the matter with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, that I know of," he said, without meeting her direct gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there is," she said, as the outcome of her slow inspection of his
      clouded features.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders and gave her his eyes steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like the way you and Miller are carrying on." He hurled the words
      at her sullenly. "You see, I know him through and through."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's all right," she replied, not flinching from his indignant
      stare; "but what's that got to do with my conduct and his?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You allow him to be too familiar with you," Alan retorted. "He's not the
      kind of a man for you to&mdash;to act that way with. He has flirted with a
      dozen women and thrown them over; he doesn't believe in the honest love of
      a man for a woman, or the love of a woman for a man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I am at the first of this!" Adele, instead of being put down by his
      stormy words, was smiling inwardly. Her lips were rigid, but Alan saw the
      light of keen amusement in her eyes. "Is he <i>really</i> so dangerous?
      That makes him doubly interesting. Most girls love to handle masculine
      gunpowder. Do you know, if I was Dolly Barclay, for instance, an affair
      with you would not be much fun, because I'd be so sure of you. The dead
      level of your past would alarm me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank Heaven, all women are not alike!" was the bolt he hurled at her.
      "If you knew as much about Ray Miller as I do, you'd act in a more
      dignified way on a first acquaintance with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On a first&mdash;oh, I see what you mean!" Adele put her handkerchief to
      her face and treated herself to a merry laugh that exasperated him beyond
      endurance. Then she stood up, smoothing her smile away. "Let's go to
      breakfast. I'm as hungry as a bear. I told Rayburn&mdash;I mean your
      dangerous friend, Mr. Miller&mdash;that we'd meet him in the dining-room.
      He says he's crazy for a cup of coffee with whipped cream in it. I ordered
      it just now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The dev&mdash;" Alan bit the word in two and strode from the room, she
      following. The first person they saw in the big dining-room was Miller,
      standing at the stove in the centre of the room warming himself. He
      scarcely looked at Alan in his eagerness to have a chair placed for Adele
      at a little table reserved for three in a corner of the room, which was
      presided over by a slick-looking mulatto waiter, whose father had belonged
      to Miller's family.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been up an hour," he said to her. "I took a stroll down the street
      to see what damage the gang did last night. Every sign is down or hung
      where it doesn't belong. To tease the owner, an old negro drayman, whom
      everybody jokes with, they took his wagon to pieces and put it together
      again on the roof of Harmon's drug-store. How they got it there is a
      puzzle that will go down in local history like the building of the
      Pyramids."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whiskey did it," laughed Adele; "that will be the final explanation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you are right," agreed Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan bolted his food in grum silence, unnoticed by the others. Adele's
      very grace at the table, as she prepared Miller's coffee, and her apt
      repartee added to his discomfiture. He excused himself from the table
      before they had finished, mumbling something about seeing if the horses
      were ready, and went into the office. The last blow to his temper was
      dealt by Adele as she came from the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Miller wants to drive me out in his buggy to show me his horses," she
      said, half smiling. "You won't mind, will you? You see, he 'll want his
      team out there to get back in, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't mind," he told her. "I see you are bent on making a goose of
      yourself. After what I've told you about Miller, if you still&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But she closed his mouth with her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave him to me, brother," she said, as she turned away. "I'm old enough
      to take care of myself, and&mdash;and&mdash;well, I know men better than
      you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Alan reached home he found that Miller and Adele had been there half
      an hour. His mother met him at the door with a mysterious smile on her
      sweet old face, as she nodded at the closed door of the parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't go in there now," she whispered. "Adele and Mr. Miller have been
      there ever since they come. I railly believe they are in love with each
      other. I never saw young folks act more like it. When I met 'em it looked
      jest like he wanted to kiss me, he was so happy. Now wouldn't it be fine
      if they was to get married? He's the nicest man in the State, and the best
      catch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mother," said Alan, "you don't understand. Rayburn Miller is&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Adele will know how to manage him," broke in the old lady, too full
      of her view of the romance to harken to his; "she ain't no fool, son. She
      'll twist him around her finger if she wants to. She's pretty, an'
      stylish, an' as sharp as a brier. Ah, he's jest seen it all and wants her;
      you can't fool me! I know how people act when they are in love. I've seen
      hundreds, and I never saw a worse case on both sides than this is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Going around to the stables to see that his horses were properly attended
      to, Alan met his uncle leaning over the rail-fence looking admiringly at a
      young colt that was prancing around the lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christmas gift," said the old man, suddenly. "I ketched you that time
      shore pop."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you got ahead of me," Alan admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man came nearer to him, nodding his head towards the house. "Heerd
      the news?" he asked, with a broad grin of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What news is that?" Alan asked, dubiously. "Young Miss," a name given
      Adele by the negroes, and sometimes used jestingly by the family&mdash;"Young
      Miss has knocked the props clean from under Miller." Alan frowned and hung
      his head for a moment; then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Uncle Ab, do you remember what I told you about Miller's opinion of love
      and women in general?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man saw his drift and burst into a full, round laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know you told me what he said about love an' women in general, but I
      don't know as you said what he thought about women in <i>particular</i>.
      This heer's a particular case. I tell you she's fixed 'im. Yore little sis
      has done the most complete job out o' tough material I ever inspected.
      He's a gone coon; he 'll never make another brag; he's tied hand an'
      foot."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan looked straight into his uncle's eyes. A light was breaking on him.
      "Uncle Ab," he said, "do you think he is&mdash;really in love with her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ef he ain't, an' don't ax yore pa an' ma fer 'er before a month's gone, I
      'll deed you my farm. Now, look heer. A feller knows his own sister less'n
      he does anybody else; that's beca'se you never have thought of Adele
      follerin' in the trail of womankind. You'd hate fer a brother o' that town
      gal to be raisin' sand about you, wouldn't you? Well, you go right on an'
      let them two kill the'r own rats."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan and his uncle were returning to the house when Pole Baker dismounted
      at the front gate and came into the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since becoming a landed proprietor his appearance had altered for the
      better most materially. He wore a neat, well-fitting suit of clothes and a
      new hat, but of the same broad dimensions as the old. Its brim was pinned
      up on the right side by a little brass ornament.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I seed Mr. Miller drive past my house awhile ago with Miss Adele," he
      said, "an' I come right over. I want to see all of you together."
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Miller came out of the parlor and descended the steps to join
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christmas gift, Mr. Miller!" cried Pole. "I ketched you that time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if I paid up, you'd cuss me out," retorted the lawyer, with a laugh.
      "I haven't forgotten the row you raised about that suit of clothes. Well,
      what's the news? How's your family?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About as common, Mr. Miller," said Pole. "My wife's gittin' younger an'
      younger ever'day. Sence she moved in 'er new house, an' got to
      whitewashin' fences an' makin' flower-beds, an' one thing another, she
      looks like a new person. I'd 'a' bought 'er a house long ago ef I'd 'a'
      knowed she wanted it that bad. Oh, we put on the lugs now! We wipe with
      napkins after eatin', an' my littlest un sets in a high-chair an' says
      'Please pass the gravy,' like he'd been off to school. Sally says she's
      a-goin' to send 'em, an' I don't keer ef she does; they 'll stand head, ef
      they go; the'r noggin' s look like squashes, but they're full o' seeds,
      an' don't you ferget it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That they are!" intoned Abner Daniel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've drapped onto a little news," said Pole. "You know what a old
      moonshiner cayn't pick up in these mountains from old pards ain't wuth
      lookin' fer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Railroad?" asked Miller, interestedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's fer you-uns to make out," said Baker. "Now, I ain't a-goin' to
      give away my authority, but I rid twenty miles yesterday to substantiate
      what I heerd, an' know it's nothin' but the truth. You all know old Bobby
      Milburn's been buyin' timber-land up about yore property, don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't know how much," answered Miller, "but I knew he had secured
      some."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fust and last in the neighborhood o' six thousand acres," affirmed Pole,
      "an' he's still on the war-path. What fust attracted my notice was findin'
      out that old Bobby hain't a dollar to his name. That made me suspicious,
      an' I went to work to investigate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good boy!" said Uncle Abner, in an admiring undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I found out he was usin' Wilson's money, an' secretly buyin' fer
      him; an' what's more, he seems to have unlimited authority, an' a big bank
      account to draw from."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a startled pause. It was broken by Miller, whose eyes were
      gleaming excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's blame good news," he said, eying Alan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think so?" said Alan, who was still under his cloud of displeasure
      with his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; it simply means that Wilson intends to build that road. He's been
      quiet, and pretending indifference, for two reasons. First, to bring us to
      closer terms, and next to secure more land. Alan, my boy, the plot
      thickens! I'm getting that fellow right where I want him. Pole, you have
      brought us a dandy Christmas gift, but I 'll be blamed if you get a thing
      for it. I don't intend to get shot."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they all went to find Bishop to tell him the news.

      T was a cold, dry day about the middle of January. They were killing hogs
      at the farm. Seven or eight negroes, men and women, had gathered from all
      about in the neighborhood to assist in the work and get the parts of the
      meat usually given away in payment for such services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hogsheads for hot water were half buried in the ground. A big iron pot
      with a fire beneath it was heating water and a long fire of logs heaped
      over with big stones was near by. When hot, the stones were to be put into
      the cooling water to raise the temperature, it being easier to do this
      than to replace the water in the pot. The hogs to be killed were grunting
      and squealing in a big pen near the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner Daniel and old man Bishop were superintending these preparations
      when Alan came from the house to say that Rayburn Miller had just ridden
      out to see them on business. "I think it's the railroad," Alan informed
      his father, who always displayed signs of almost childish excitement when
      the subject came up. They found Miller in the parlor being entertained by
      Adele, who immediately left the room on their arrival. They all sat down
      before the cheerful fire. Miller showed certain signs of embarrassment at
      first, but gradually threw them off and got down to the matter in hand
      quite with his office manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got a proposition to make to you, Mr. Bishop," he opened up, with a
      slight flush on his face. "I've been making some inquiries about Wilson,
      and I am more and more convinced that he intends to freeze us out&mdash;or
      you rather&mdash;by holding off till you are obliged to sell your property
      for a much lower figure than you now ask him for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think so," grunted Bishop, pulling a long face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but what I now want to do is to show him, indirectly, that we are
      independent of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh!" ejaculated Bishop, even more dejectedly&mdash;"huh! I say!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan was looking at Miller eagerly, as if trying to divine the point he
      was about to make. "I must confess," he smiled, "that I can' t well see
      how we can show independence right now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I think I see a way," said Miller, the flush stealing over his face
      again. "You see, there is no doubt that Wilson is on his high horse simply
      because he thinks he could call on you for that twenty-five thousand
      dollars and put you to some trouble raising it without&mdash;without, I
      say, throwing your land on the market. I can' t blame him," Miller went
      on, smiling, "for it's only what any business man would do, who is out for
      profit, but we must not knuckle to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh, huh!" Bishop grunted, in deeper despondency.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you propose to get around the knuckling process?" asked Alan, who
      had caught the depression influencing his parent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd simply take up that note," said the lawyer. "You know, under the
      contract, we are privileged to pay it to-morrow if we wish. It would
      simply paralyze him. He's so confident that you can' t take it up that he
      has not even written to ask if you want to renew it or not. Yes; he's
      confident that he 'll rake in that security&mdash;so confident that he has
      been, as you know, secretly buying land near yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Bishop's eyes were wide open. In the somewhat darkened room the
      firelight reflected in them showed like illuminated blood-spots. He said
      nothing, but breathed heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," exclaimed Alan, "Ray, you know we&mdash;father has invested that
      money, and the truth is, that he and mother have already had so much worry
      over the business that they would rather let the land go at what was
      raised on it than to&mdash;to run any more risks."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop groaned out his approval of this elucidation of his condition and
      sat silently nodding his head. The very thought of further risks stunned
      and chilled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller's embarrassment now descended on him in full force.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was not thinking of having your father disturb his investments," he
      said. "The truth is, I have met with a little financial disappointment in
      a certain direction. For the last three months I have been raking and
      scraping among the dry bones of my investments to get up exactly
      twenty-five thousand dollars to secure a leading interest in a cotton mill
      at Darley, of which I was to be president. I managed to get the money
      together and only yesterday I learned that the Northern capital that was
      to guarantee the thing was only in the corner of a fellow's eye up in
      Boston&mdash;a man that had not a dollar on earth. Well, there you are!
      I've my twenty-five thousand dollars, and no place to put it. I thought,
      if you had just as soon owe me the money as Wilson, that you'd really be
      doing me a favor to let me take up the note. You see, it would actually
      floor him. He means business, and this would show him that we are not
      asking any favors of him. In fact, I have an idea it would scare him out
      of his skin. He'd think we had another opportunity of selling. I'm dying
      to do this, and I hope you 'll let me work it. Really, I think you ought
      to consent. I'd never drive you to the wall and&mdash;well&mdash;<i>he</i>
      might."
    </p>
    <p>
      All eyes were on the speaker. Bishop had the dazed expression of a
      bewildered man trying to believe in sudden good luck. Abner Daniel lowered
      his head and shook with low, subdued laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a jim-dandy, young man," he said to Miller. "That's all there is
      about it. You take the rag off the bush. Oh, my Lord! They say in Alt's
      meeting-house that it's a sin to play poker with no stakes, but Alf's in a
      game with half the earth put up agin another feller's wad as big as a bale
      o' hay. Play down, Alf. Play down. You've got a full hand an' plenty to
      draw from."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We couldn't let you do this, Ray," expostulated Alan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I assure you it is merely a matter of business with me," declared the
      lawyer. "You know I'm interested myself, and I believe we shall come out
      all right. I'm simply itching to do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop's face was ablaze. The assurance that a wise young business man
      would consider a purchase of his of sufficient value to put a large amount
      of money on pleased him, banished his fears, thrilled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you feel that way," he said, smiling at the corners of his mouth, "go
      ahead. I don't know but what you are plumb right. It will show Wilson that
      we ain't beholden to him, an' will set 'im to work ef anything will."
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was finally settled, and no one seemed so well pleased with the
      arrangement as Miller himself. Adele entered the room with the air of one
      half fearful of intruding, and her three relatives quietly withdrew,
      leaving her to entertain the guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder what's the matter with your brother," Miller remarked, as his
      eyes followed Alan from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, brother?" laughed Adele. "No one tries to keep up with his whims and
      fancies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, really," said Miller, in a serious tone, "he has mystified me
      lately. I wonder if he has had bad news from Dolly. I've tried to get into
      a confidential chat with him several times of late, but he seems to get
      around it. Really, it seems to me, at times, that he treats me rather
      coldly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, if you waste time noticing Al you 'll become a beggar," and Adele
      gave another amused laugh. "Take my advice and let him alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I almost believe you know what ails him," said Miller, eying her closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know what he <i>thinks</i> ails him," the girl responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And won't you tell me what&mdash;what he thinks ails him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I couldn't do that," answered our young lady, with a knowing smile.
      "If you are ever any wiser on the subject you will have to get your wisdom
      from him."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to the piano and began to arrange some scattered pieces of
      music, and he remained on the hearth, his back to the fire, his brow
      wrinkled in pleased perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll have to get my wisdom from him," repeated Miller, pronouncing each
      word with separate distinctness, as if one of them might prove the key to
      the mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I should think two wise men could settle a little thing like that.
      If not, you may call in the third&mdash;you know there were three of you,
      according to the Bible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, so there were," smiled Miller; "but it's hard to tell when we three
      shall meet again. The last time I saw the other two they were having their
      sandals half-soled for a tramp across the desert. I came this way to build
      a railroad, and I believe I'm going to do it. That's linking ancient and
      modern times together with a coupling-pin, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She came from the piano and stood by him, looking down into the fire.
      "Ah," she said, seriously, "if you could <i>only</i> do it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you like it very much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very, very much; it means the world to us&mdash;to Alan, to father and
      mother, and&mdash;yes, to me. I hunger for independence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it shall be done," he said, fervently.

    <p>
      S the elevator in the big building was taking Rayburn Miller up to the
      offices of the Southern Land and Timber Company, many reflections passed
      hurriedly through his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are going to get the usual cold shoulder from Wilson," he mused; "but
      he 'll put it up against something about as warm as he's touched in many a
      day. If you don't make him squirm, it will be only because you don't want
      to."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson was busy at his desk looking over bills of lading, receipts, and
      other papers, and now and then giving instructions to a typewriter in the
      corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ahl how are you, Miller?" he said, indifferently, giving the caller his
      hand without rising. "Down to see the city again, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rayburn leaned on the top of the desk, and knocked the ashes from his
      cigar with the tip of his little finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Partly that and partly business," he returned, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two birds, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's about it. I concluded you were not coming up our way soon, and so
      I decided to drop in on you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, glad you did." Wilson glanced at the papers on his desk and frowned.
      "Wish I had more time at my disposal. I'd run up to the club with you and
      show you my Kentucky thoroughbreds, but I realty am rushed, to-day
      particularly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I haven't a bit of time to spare myself! I take the afternoon train
      home. The truth is, I came to see you for my clients, the Bishops."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I see." Wilson's face clouded over by some mechanical arrangement
      known only to himself. "Well, I can' t realty report any progress in that
      matter," he said. "All the company think Bishop's figures are away out of
      reason, and the truth is, right now, we are over head and ears in
      operations in other quarters, and&mdash;well, you see how it is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I think I do." Miller smoked a moment. "In fact, I told my clients
      last month that the matter was not absorbing your attention, and so they
      gave up counting on you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson so far forgot his pose that he looked up in a startled sort of way
      and began to study Miller's smoke-wrapped profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say they are not&mdash;have not been counting on my company to&mdash;to
      buy their land?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, no," said Miller, in accents well resembling those of slow and
      genuine surprise. "Why, you have not shown the slightest interest in the
      matter since the day you made the loan, and naturally they ceased to think
      you wanted the land. The only reason I called was that the note is payable
      to-day, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, by Jove! that was careless of me. The interest is due. I knew it
      would be all right, and I had no idea you would bother to run down for
      that. Why, my boy, we could have drawn for it, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller smiled inwardly, as he looked calmly and fixedly through his smoke
      into the unsuspecting visage upturned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the note itself is payable to-day," he said, closely on the alert for
      a facial collapse; "and, while you or I might take up a paper for
      twenty-five thousand dollars through a bank, old-fashioned people like Mr.
      and Mrs. Bishop would feel safer to have it done by an agent. That's why I
      came."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller, in silent satisfaction, saw the face of his antagonist fall to
      pieces like an artificial flower suddenly shattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pay the note?" gasped Wilson. "Why&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller puffed at his cigar and gazed at his victim as if slightly
      surprised over the assumption that his clients had not, all along,
      intended to avail themselves of that condition in their contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean that the Bishops are ready to&mdash;" Wilson began again on
      another breath&mdash;"to pay us the twenty-five thousand dollars?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the interest for six months," quietly added Miller, reaching for a
      match on the desk. "I reckon you've got the note here. I don't want to
      miss my train."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson was a good business man, but his Puritanical training in New
      England had not fitted him for wily diplomacy; besides, he had not
      expected to meet a diplomat that day, and did not, even now, realize that
      he was in the hands of one. He still believed that Miller was only a
      half-educated country lawyer who had barely enough brains and experience
      to succeed as a legal servant for mountain clients. Hence, he now made
      little effort to conceal his embarrassment into which the sudden turn of
      affairs had plunged him. In awkward silence he squirmed in his big chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, they can take up their note to-day if they wish," he said,
      with alarmed frankness. "I was not counting on it, though." He rose to his
      feet. Miller's watchful eye detected a certain trembling of his lower lip.
      He thrust his hands into his pockets nervously; and in a tone of open
      irritation he said to the young man at the typewriter: "Brown, I wish
      you'd let up on that infernal clicking; sometimes I can stand it, and then
      again I can' t. You can do those letters in the next room."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the young man had gone out, carrying his machine, Wilson turned to
      Miller. "As I understand it, you, personally, have no interest in the
      Bishop property?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, not a dollar!" smiled the lawyer. "I'm only acting for them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then"&mdash;Wilson drove his hands into his pockets again&mdash;"perhaps
      you wouldn't mind telling me if the Bishops are on trade with other
      parties. Are they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller smiled and shook his head. "As their lawyer, Mr. Wilson, I simply
      couldn't answer that question."
    </p>
    <p>
      The blow was well directed and it struck a vulnerable spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon," Wilson stammered. "I did not mean to suggest that you
      would betray confidence." He reflected a moment, and then he said, in a
      flurried tone, "They have not actually sold out, have they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller was silent for a moment, then he answered: "I don't see any reason
      why I may not answer that question I don't think my clients would object
      to my saying that they have not yet accepted any offer."
    </p>
    <p>
      A look of relief suffused itself over Wilson's broad face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then they are still open to accept their offer to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller laughed as if highly amused at the complication of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are bound, you remember, only so long as you hold their note."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I tell you what to do," proposed Wilson. "Go back and tell them not
      to bother about payment, for a few days, anyway, and that we will soon
      tell them positively whether we will pay their price or not. That's fair,
      isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might seem so to a man personally interested in the deal," admitted
      Miller, as the introduction to another of his blows from the shoulder;
      "but as lawyer for my clients I can only obey orders, like the boy who
      stood on the burning deck."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson's face fell. The remote clicking of the typewriter seemed to grate
      upon his high-wrought nerves, and he went and slammed the partly opened
      door, muttering something like an oath. On that slight journey, however,
      he caught an idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose you wire them my proposition and wait here for a reply," he
      suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller frowned. "That would do no good," he said. "I'm sorry I can' t
      explain fully, but the truth is this: I happen to know that they wish, for
      reasons of their own, to take up the note you hold, and that nothing else
      will suit them."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Wilson lost his grip on all self-possession, and
      degenerated into the sullen anger of sharp and unexpected disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't feel that we are being fairly treated," he said. "We most
      naturally assumed that your clients wanted to&mdash;to extend our option
      on the property for at least another six months. We assumed that from the
      fact that we had no notification from them that they would be ready to pay
      the note to-day. That's where we feel injured, Mr. Miller."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rayburn threw his cigar into a cuspidor; his attitude of being a
      non-interested agent was simply a stroke of genius. Behind this plea he
      crouched, showing himself only to fire shots that played havoc with
      whatever they struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe my clients <i>did</i> feel, I may say, honor bound to you to
      sell for the price they offered; but&mdash;now I may be mistaken&mdash;but
      I'm sure they were under the impression, as I was, too, that you only
      wanted the property provided you could build a railroad from Dar-ley to
      it, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's true," broke in Wilson. "That's quite true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And," finished Miller, still behind his inevitable fortification, "they
      tell me that you have certainly shown indifference to the project ever
      since the note was given. In fact, they asked me pointedly if I thought
      you meant business, and I was forced, conscientiously, to tell them that I
      thought you seemed to have other fish to fry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson glared at the lawyer as if he wanted to kick him for a stupid idiot
      who could not do two things at once&mdash;work for the interests of his
      clients and not wreck his plans also. It had been a long time since he had
      found himself in such a hot frying-pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you think the thing is off," he said, desperately, probably recalling
      several purchases of land he had made in the section he had expected to
      develop. "You think it's off?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hardly know what to say," said Miller. "The old gentleman, Mr. Bishop,
      is a slow-going old-timer, but his son is rather up to date, full of
      energy and ambition. I think he's made up his mind to sell that property."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson went to his desk, hovered over it like a dark, human cloud, and
      then reluctantly turned to the big iron safe against the wall, obviously
      to get the note. His disappointment was too great for concealment. With
      his fat, pink hand on the silver-plated combination-bolt he turned to
      Miller again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you mind sitting down till I telephone one or two of the
      directors?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all," said Miller, "if you 'll get me a cigar and the <i>Constitution</i>.
      The Atlanta baseball team played Mobile yesterday, and I was wondering&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't keep track of such things," said Wilson, coming back to his desk,
      with an impatient frown, to ring his call-bell for the office-boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, I believe football is your national sport," said Miller, with a
      dry smile. "Well, it's only a difference between arms and legs&mdash;whole
      bones and casualties."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson ordered the cigar and paper when the boy appeared, and, leaving the
      lawyer suddenly, he went into the room containing the telephone, closing
      the door after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes he reappeared, standing before Miller, who was chewing a
      cold cigar and attentively reading. He looked up at Wilson abstractedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bully for Atlanta!" he said. "The boys made ten runs before the Mobiles
      had scored&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, come down to business!" said the New-Eng-lander, with a ready-made
      smile. "Honestly, I don't believe you drowsy Southerners ever will get
      over your habit of sleeping during business hours. It seems to be bred in
      the bone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller laughed misleadingly. "Try to down us at a horse-race and we 'll
      beat you in the middle of the night. Hang it all, man, you don't know
      human nature, that's all! How can you expect me, on my measly fees, to
      dance a breakdown over business I am transacting for other people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that may account for it," admitted Wilson, who seemed bent on being
      more agreeable in the light of some fresh hopes he had absorbed from the
      telephone-wires. "See here, I've got a rock-bottom proposal to make to
      your people. Now listen, and drop that damned paper for a minute. By Jove!
      if I had to send a man from your State to attend to legal business I'd
      pick one not full of mental morphine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you wouldn't?" Miller laid down the paper and assumed a posture
      indicative of attention roused from deep sleep. "Fire away. I'm
      listening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I already had authority to act for the company, but I thought it best to
      telephone some of the directors." Wilson sat down in his chair and leaned
      towards the lawyer. "Here's what we will do. The whole truth is, we are
      willing to plank down the required one hundred thousand for that property,
      provided we can lay our road there without incurring the expense of
      purchasing the right of way. Now if the citizens along the proposed line
      want their country developed bad enough to donate the right of way through
      their lands, we can trade."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. Then Miller broke it by striking a match on the sole of
      his boot. He looked crosseyed at the flame as he applied it to his cigar.
      "Don't you think your people could stand whatever value is appraised by
      law in case of refusals along the line?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Wilson. "The price for the land is too steep for that. Your
      clients have our ultimatum. What do you say? We can advertise a meeting of
      citizens at Springtown, which is about the centre of the territory
      involved, and if all agree to give the right of way it will be a trade. We
      can have the meeting set for to-day two weeks. How does that strike you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd have to wire my clients."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When can you get an answer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller looked at his watch. "By five o' clock this afternoon. The message
      would have to go into the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then send it off at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes after five o' clock Miller sauntered into the office. Wilson
      sat at his desk and looked up eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" he asked, almost under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer leaned on the top of the desk. "They are willing to grant you
      the two weeks' time, provided you sign an agreement for your firm that you
      will purchase their property at the price named at the expiration of that
      time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With the provision," interpolated Wilson, "that a right of way is
      donated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, with that provision," Miller nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then sit down here and write out your paper."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller complied as nonchalantly as if he were drawing up a bill of sale
      for a worn-out horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you are," he said, pushing the paper to Wilson when he had
      finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson read it critically. "It certainly is binding," he said. "You people
      may sleep during business hours, but you have your eyes open when you draw
      up papers. However, I don't care; I want the Bishops to feel secure. They
      must get to work to secure the right of way. It will be no easy job, I 'll
      let you know. I've struck shrewd, obstinate people in my life, but those
      up there beat the world. Noah couldn't have driven them in the ark, even
      after the Flood set in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know something about them, then?" said Miller, laughing to himself
      over the implied confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson flushed, and then admitted that he had been up that way several
      times looking the situation over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How about the charter?" asked Miller, indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's fixed. I have already seen to that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it all depends on the right of way," remarked the lawyer as he drew
      a check from his pocket and handed it to Wilson. "Now get me that note,"
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson brought it from the safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Turning this over cuts my option down to two weeks," he said. "But we 'll
      know at the meeting what can be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, we 'll know then what they can do with <i>you</i>," said Miller,
      significantly, as he put the cancelled note in his pocket and rose to go.

    <p>
      HEN Miller's train reached Darley and he alighted in the car-shed, he was
      met by a blinding snow-storm. He could see the dim lantern of the hotel
      porter as he came towards him through the slanting feathery sheet and the
      yet dimmer lights of the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heer! Marse Miller!" shouted the darky; "look out fer dat plank er you
      'll fall in er ditch. Marse Alan Bishop is at de hotel, an' he say tell
      you ter stop dar&mdash;dat you couldn't git home in dis sto'm no how."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he's in town," said Miller. "Well, I was thinking of spending the
      night at the hotel, anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the office of the hotel, almost the only occupant of the room besides
      the clerk, sat Abner Daniel, at the red-hot coal stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," exclaimed Miller, in surprise, "I didn't know you were in town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact is, we're all heer," smiled the old man, standing up and
      stretching himself. He looked as if he had been napping. "We fetched the
      women in to do some tradin', an' this storm blowed up. We could 'a' made
      it home all right," he laughed out impulsively, "but the last one of 'em
      wanted a excuse to stay over. They are et up with curiosity to know how
      yore trip come out. They are all up in Betsy an' Alf's room. Go up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I reckon I'd better relieve their minds."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner offered to pilot him to the room in question, and when it was
      reached the old man opened the door without knocking. "Heer's the man
      you've been hankerin' to see all day," he announced, jovially. "I fetched
      'im straight up."
    </p>
    <p>
      They all rose from their seats around the big grate-fire and shook hands
      with the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He looks like he has news of some kind," said Adele, who was studying his
      face attentively. "Now, sir, sit down and tell us are we to be rich or
      poor, bankrupt or robber."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't put the most likely word last," said Abner, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," began Miller, as he sat down in the semicircle. "As it now stands,
      we've got a chance to gain our point. I have a signed agreement&mdash;and
      a good one&mdash;that your price will be paid if we can get the citizens
      through whose property the road passes to donate a right of way. That's
      the only thing that now stands between you and a cash sale."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They 'll do it, I think," declared Alan, elatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dunno about that," said Abner. "It's owin' to whose land is to be
      donated. Thar's some skunks over in them mountains that wouldn't let the
      gates o' heaven swing over the'r property except to let themselves
      through."
    </p>
    <p>
      No one laughed at this remark save Abner himself. Mrs. Bishop was staring
      straight into the fire. Her husband leaned forward and twirled his stiff
      fingers slowly in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh! So it depends on <i>that</i>," he said. "Well, it <i>does</i> look
      like mighty nigh anybody ud ruther see a railroad run out thar than not,
      but I'm no judge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it is to be tested two weeks from now," Miller said. And then he
      went into a detailed and amusing account of how he had brought Wilson to
      terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that beats the Dutch!" laughed Abner. "I'd ruther 'a' been thar 'an
      to a circus. You worked 'im to a queen's taste&mdash;as fine as split
      silk. You 'n' Pole Baker'd make a good team&mdash;you to look after the
      bon-tons an' him to rake in the scum o' mankind. I don't know but Pole
      could dress up an' look after both ends, once in a while, ef you wanted to
      take a rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm always sorry when I heer of it bein' necessary to resort to
      trickery," ventured Mrs. Bishop, in her mild way. "It don't look exactly
      right to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like it, nuther," said Bishop. "Ef the land's wuth the money, an'&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The trouble with Alf," broke in Abner, "is that with all his Bible
      readin' he never seems to git any practical benefit out'n it. Now, when
      I'm in doubt about whether a thing's right or wrong, I generally find some
      Scriptural sanction fer the side I want to win. Some'rs in the Bible thar
      was a big, rich king that sent a pore feller off to git 'im kilt in battle
      so he could add his woman to his collection. Now, no harm ever come to the
      king that I know of, an', fer my part, I don't think what you did to yank
      Wilson into line was nigh as bad, beca'se you was work-in' fer friends.
      Then Wilson was loaded fer bear his-se'f. War's over, I reckon, but when
      Wilson's sort comes down heer expectin' to ride rough-shod over us agin, I
      feel like givin' a war-whoop an' rammin' home a Mini ball."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sha 'n't worry about the morality of the thing," said Miller. "Wilson
      was dead set on crushing you to powder. I saw that. Besides, if he takes
      the property and builds the road, he 'll make a lot of money out of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      After this the conversation languished, and, thinking that the old people
      might wish to retire, Miller bade them good-night and went to his own
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A snow of sufficient thickness for sleighing in that locality was a rare
      occurrence, and the next morning an odd scene presented itself in front of
      the hotel. The young men of the near-by stores had hastily improvised
      sleds by taking the wheels from buggies and fastening the axles to rough
      wooden runners, and were making engagements to take the young ladies of
      the town sleighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever ridden in a sleigh?" Miller asked Adele, as they stood at a
      window in the parlor witnessing these preparations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never in my life," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you shall," he said. "I 'll set a carpenter at work on my buggy,
      and be after you in an hour. Get your wraps. My pair of horses will make
      one of those sleds fairly spin."
    </p>
    <p>
      About eleven o' clock that morning Alan saw them returning from their
      ride, and, much to his surprise, he noted that Dolly Barclay was with
      them. As they drew up at the entrance of the hotel, Alan doffed his hat
      and stepped forward to assist the ladies out of the sled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Dolly won't stop," said Miller. "Get in and drive her around. She's
      hardly had a taste of it; we only picked her up as we passed her house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan's heart bounded and then it sank. Miller was smiling at him
      knowingly. "Go ahead," he said, pushing him gently towards the sled. "It's
      all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly knowing if he were acting wisely, Alan took the reins and sat down
      by Dolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adele stepped up behind to say good-bye to Dolly, and they kissed each
      other. It was barely audible, and yet it reached the ears of the restive
      horses and they bounded away like the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A peculiar way to start horses," Alan laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pleasant way," she said. "Your sister is a dear, dear girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he told her his fears in regard to what her father would think of his
      driving with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's out of town to-day," she answered, with a frank upward glance, "and
      mother wouldn't care."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'm going to enjoy it fully," he said. "I've been dying to see you,
      Dolly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you suppose I haven't wanted to see you? When Mr. Miller proposed
      this just now it fairly took my breath away. I was afraid you might happen
      not to be around the hotel. Oh, there is so much I want to say&mdash;and
      so little time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I'm with you I can' t talk," he said. "It seems, in some way, to
      take up time like the ticking of a clock. I simply want to close my eyes,
      and&mdash;be with you, Dolly&mdash;<i>YOU</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, but we must be practical, and think of the future. Mr. Miller
      tells me there is a chance for your big scheme to succeed. Oh, if it only
      would!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, a pretty good chance," he told her; "but even then your father&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'd not hold out against you then," said Dolly, just for an impulsive
      moment clasping his arm as they shot through a snow-drift and turned a
      corner of the street leading into the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it must succeed," he said, looking at her tenderly. "It <i>must</i>,
      Dolly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall pray for it&mdash;that and nothing else."
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling the slack reins on their backs, the horses slowed up till they
      were plodding along lazily. Suddenly the sled began to drag on the clay
      road where the wind had bared it of snow, and the horses stopped of their
      own accord, looking back at their increased burden inquiringly. Alan made
      no effort to start them on again. It was a sequestered spot, well hidden
      from the rest of the road by an old hedge of Osage orange bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must not stop, <i>dear</i>," Dolly said, laying her hand again on his
      arm. "You know driving is&mdash;is different from this. As long as we are
      moving in any direction, I have no scruples, but to stop here in the road&mdash;no,
      it won't do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was just wondering if we can start them," he said, a mischievous look
      in his laughing eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Start them?" She extended her hand for the reins, but he held them out of
      her reach. "Why, what do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you saw the way they were started at the hotel," he answered, in
      quite a serious tone. "Ray has trained them-that way. They won't budge an
      inch unless&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you silly boy!" Dolly was flushing charmingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's true," he said. "I'm sorry if you object, for it's absolutely the
      only available way."
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her full, trusting eyes to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You make me want to kiss you, Alan, but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not let her finish. Putting his arm around her, he drew her close
      to him and kissed her on the lips. "Now, darling," he said, "you are
      mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I am yours, Alan."
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were nearing her house he told her that Wilson had agents out
      secretly buying land, and that she must not allow her father to dispose of
      his timbered interests until it was decided whether the railroad would be
      built.
    </p>
    <p>
      She promised to keep an eye on the Colonel's transactions and do all she
      could to prevent him from taking a false step. "You may not know it," she
      said, "but I'm his chief adviser. He 'll be apt to mention any offer he
      gets to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, don't tell him about the railroad unless you have to," he said, in
      parting with her at the gate. "But it would be glorious to have him profit
      by our scheme, and I think he will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are going to hope for success, anyway, aren't we?" she said, leaning
      over the gate. "I have believed in you so much that I feel almost sure you
      are to be rewarded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miller thinks the chances are good," he told her, "but father is afraid
      those men over there will do their best to ruin the whole thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly waved her handkerchief to some one at a window of the house. "It's
      mother," she said. "She's shaking her finger at me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon she's mad at me," said Alan, disconsolately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much," Dolly laughed. "She's simply crazy to come out and gossip with
      us. She would, too, if she wasn't afraid of father. Oh, young man, you 'll
      have a mother-in-law that will reverse the order of things! Instead of her
      keeping you straight, you 'll have to help us manage her. Father says
      she's 'as wild as a buck.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      They both laughed from the fulness of their happiness. A buggy on runners
      dashed by. It contained a pair of lovers, who shouted and waved their
      hands. The sun was shining broadly. The snow would not last long. The
      crudest sled of all passed in the wake of the other. It was simply a plank
      about twelve inches wide and ten feet long to which a gaunt, limping horse
      was hitched. On the plank stood a triumphant lad balancing himself with
      the skill of a bareback rider. His face was flushed; he had never been so
      full of joy and ozone. From the other direction came a gigantic concern
      looking like a snow-plough or a metropolitan street-sweeper. It was a
      sliding road-wagon to which Frank Hillhouse had hitched four sturdy mules.
      The wagon was full of girls. Frank sat on the front seat cracking a whip
      and smoking. A little negro boy sat astride of the leading mule, digging
      his rag-clothed heels into the animal's side. Frank bowed as he passed,
      but his face was rigid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He didn't intend to ask me," said Dolly. "He hardly speaks to me since&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since what?" Alan questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since I asked him not to come to see me so often. I had to do it. He was
      making a fool of himself. It had to stop."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You refused him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but you must go now." Dolly was laughing again. "Mother will be out
      here in a minute; she can't curb her curiosity any longer. She'd make you
      take her riding, and I wouldn't have you do it for the world. Good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, you must hope for the best, Alan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to. Good-bye."

    <p>
      OLLY had the opportunity to warn her father in regard to his financial
      interests sooner than she expected. The very next morning, as she sat
      reading at a window in the sitting-room, she overheard the Colonel
      speaking to her mother about an offer he had just had for his mountain
      property.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe it's a good chance for me to get rid of it," he was saying, as
      he stood at the mantel-piece dipping his pipe into his blue tobacco-jar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never did see any sense in paying taxes on land you have never seen,"
      said Mrs. Barclay, at her sewing-machine. "Surely you can put the money
      where it will bring in something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Milburn wants it because there is about a hundred acres that could be
      cleared for cultivation. I'm of the opinion that it won't make as good
      soil as he thinks, but I'm not going to tell him that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you be getting as much as it cost you?" asked Mrs. Barclay,
      smoothing down a white hem with her thumb-nail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About five hundred more," her husband chuckled. "People said when I
      bought it that I was as big a fool as old Bishop, but you see I've already
      struck a purchaser at a profit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Dolly spoke up from behind her newspaper: "I wouldn't sell it, papa,"
      she said, coloring under the task before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you wouldn't?" sniffed her father. "And why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because it's going to be worth a good deal more money," she affirmed,
      coloring deeper and yet looking her parent fairly in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Barclay broke into a rippling titter as she bent over her work. "Alan
      Bishop put that in her head," she said. "They think, the Bishops do, that
      they've got a gold-mine over there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must not sell it, papa," Dolly went on, ignoring her mother's thrust.
      "I can't tell you why I don't want you to, but you must not&mdash;you 'll
      be sorry if you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know how I'm to keep on paying your bills for flimflam frippery
      if I don't sell something," retorted the old man, almost and yet not quite
      angry. Indirectly he was pleased at her valuation of his property, for he
      had discovered that her judgment was good.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she won't let Frank Hillhouse help," put in Mrs. Barclay, teasingly.
      "Poor fellow! I'm afraid he 'll never get over it. He's taken to running
      around with school-girls&mdash;that's always a bad sign."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A girl ought to be made to listen to reason," fumed Barclay, goaded on to
      this attack by his wife, who well knew his sore spots, and liked to rasp
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A girl will listen to the right sort of reason," retorted Dolly, who was
      valiantly struggling against an outburst. "Mamma knows how I feel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that you are bent on marrying a man without a dollar to his name,"
      said her father. "You want to get into that visionary gang that will spend
      all I leave you in their wild-cat investments, but I tell you I will cut
      you out of my property if you do. Now, remember that. I mean it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly crushed the newspaper in her lap and rose. "There is no good in
      quarrelling over this again," she said, coldly. "Some day you will
      understand the injustice you are doing Alan Bishop. I could make you see
      it now, but I have no right to explain." And with that she left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later, from the window of her room up-stairs, she saw old
      Bobby Milburn open the front gate. Under his slouch hat and big gray shawl
      he thumped up the gravelled walk and began to scrape his feet on the
      steps. There was a door-bell, with a handle like that of a coffee-mill, to
      be turned round, but old Bobby, like many of his kind, either did not know
      of its existence, or, knowing, dreaded the use of innovations that
      sometimes made even stoics like himself feel ridiculous. His method of
      announcing himself was by far more sensible, as it did not even require
      the removal of his hands from his pockets; and, at the same time, helped
      divest his boots of mud. He stamped on the floor of the veranda loudly and
      paused to listen for the approach of some one to admit him. Then, as no
      one appeared, he clattered along the veranda to the window of the
      sitting-room and peered in. Colonel Barclay saw him and opened the door,
      inviting the old fellow into the sitting-room. Old Bobby laid his hat on
      the floor beside his chair as he sat down, but he did not unpin his shawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I've come round to know what's yore lowest notch, Colonel," he
      said, gruffly, as he brushed his long, stringy hair back from his ears and
      side whiskers. "You see, it's jest this way. I kin git a patch o' land
      from Lank Buford that will do me, in a pinch, but I like yore'n a leetle
      grain better, beca'se it's nigher my line by a quarter or so; but, as I
      say, I kin make out with Buford's piece; an' ef we cayn't agree, I 'll
      have to ride over whar he is workin' in Springtown."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Dolly came into the room. She shook hands with the
      visitor, who remained seated and mumbled out some sort of gruff greeting,
      and went to her chair near the window, taking up her paper again. Her
      eyes, however, were on her father's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hardly know what to say," answered Barclay, deliberately. "Your price
      the other day didn't strike me just right, and so I really haven't been
      thinking about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was concession enough, Dolly thought, in Milburn's eye, if not in
      his voice, when he spoke. "Well," he said, carelessly, "bein' as me'n you
      are old friends, an' thar always was a sort o' neighborly feelin' betwixt
      us, I 'll agree, if we trade, to hire a lawyer an' a scribe to draw up the
      papers an' have 'em duly recorded. You know that's always done by the
      party sellin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that's a <i>little</i> thing," said the Colonel; but his watchful
      daughter saw that the mere smallness of Milburn's raise in his offer had
      had a depressing effect on her father's rather doubtful valuation of the
      property in question. The truth was that Wilson had employed the shrewdest
      trader in all that part of the country, and one who worked all the more
      effectively for his plainness of dress and rough manner. "That's a little
      thing," went on the Colonel, "but here's what I 'll do&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father," broke in Dolly, "don't make a proposition to Mr. Milburn. Please
      don't."
    </p>
    <p>
      Milburn turned to her, his big brows contracting in surprise, but he
      controlled himself. "Heigho!" he laughed, "so you've turned trader, too,
      Miss Dolly? Now, I jest wish my gals had that much enterprise; they git
      beat ef they buy a spool o' thread."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel frowned and Mrs. Barclay turned to Dolly with a real tone of
      reproof. "Don't interfere in your father's business," she said. "He can
      attend to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel was not above making capital of the interruption, and he
      smiled down on the shaggy visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's been deviling the life out of me not to part with that land. They
      say women have the intuition to look ahead better than men. I don't know
      but I ought to listen to her, but she ain't running me, and as I was about
      to say&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait just one minute, papa!" insisted Dolly, with a grim look of
      determination on her face. "Just let me speak to you a moment in the
      parlor, and then you can come back to Mr. Milburn."
    </p>
    <p>
      The face of the Colonel darkened under impatience, but he was afraid
      failure to grant his daughter's request would look like over-anxiety to
      close with Mil-burn, and so he followed her into the parlor across the
      hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, what on earth is the matter with you?" he demanded, sternly. "I have
      never seen you conduct yourself like this before."
    </p>
    <p>
      She faced him, touching his arms with her two hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father, don't be angry with me," she said, "but when you know what I do,
      you will be glad I stopped you just now. Mr. Milburn is not buying that
      land for his own use."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He isn't?" exclaimed the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; he's secretly employed by a concern worth over two million dollars&mdash;the
      Southern Land and Timber Company of Atlanta."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" the word came out as suddenly as if some one had struck him on the
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," answered the girl, now pale and agitated. "To save Mr. Bishop from
      loss, Alan and Rayburn Miller have worked up a scheme to build a railroad
      from Darley to the Bishop property. All arrangements have been made. There
      can be no hitch in it unless the citizens refuse to grant a right of way.
      In a week from now a meeting is to be advertised. Of course, it is not a
      certainty, but you can see that the chance is good, and you ought not to
      sacrifice your land."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens!" ejaculated Barclay, his eyes distended, "is this a fact?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am telling you what I have really no right to reveal," said Dolly, "but
      I promised Alan not to let you sell if I could help it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel was staggered by the revelation; his face was working under
      strong excitement. "I thought that old rascal"&mdash;he meant Milburn&mdash;"was
      powerfully anxious to trade. Huh! Looky' here, daughter, this news is
      almost too good to be true. Why, another railroad would make my town-lots
      bound up like fury, and as for this mountain-land&mdash;whew! It may be as
      you say. Ray Miller certainly is a wheel-horse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not his idea," said Dolly, loyally. "In fact, he tried his best to
      discourage Alan at first&mdash;till he saw what could be done. Since then
      he's been secretly working at it night and day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whew!" whistled the Colonel. "I don't care a cent <i>whose</i> idea it
      is; if it goes through it's a good one, and, now that I think of it, the
      necessary capital is all that is needed to make a big spec' over there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you won't sell to Mr. Milburn, then?" asked Dolly, humbly grateful for
      her father's change of mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sell to that old dough-faced scamp?" snorted Barclay. "Well, he 'll think
      I won't in a minute! Do you reckon I don't want to have some sort o'
      finger in the pie? Whether the road's built or not, I want my chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But remember I am giving away state secrets," said Dolly. "He must not
      know that you have heard about the road."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll not give that away," the old man promised, with a smile, and he
      turned to the door as if eager to face Milburn. "Huh! That old scamp
      coming here to do me one! The idea!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men, as they faced each other a moment later, presented an
      interesting study of human forces held well in check. The Colonel leaned
      on the mantel-piece and looked down at the toe of his boot, with which he
      pushed a chunk of wood beneath the logs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You never can tell about a woman' s whims, Mil-burn," he said. "Dolly's
      set her heart on holding onto that land, and I reckon I'm too easily
      wriggled about by my women folks. I reckon we'd better call it off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, all right&mdash;all right!" said Milburn, with a start and a sharp
      contraction of his brows. "I'm that away some myse'f. My gals git me into
      devilish scrapes sometimes, an' I'm always sayin' they got to stop it. A
      man loses too much by lettin' 'em dabble in his business. But I was jest
      goin' to say that I mought raise my bid fifty cents on the acre ruther
      than trapse away over to Springtown to see Buford."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence through which several kinds of thoughts percolated. The
      raise really amounted to so much that it materially increased Barclay's
      growing conviction that the railroad was next to a certainty. "Huh!" he
      grunted, his eyes ablaze with the amusement of a winner. "I wouldn't
      listen to less than a dollar more on the acre." And as the gaze of Milburn
      went down reflectively the Colonel winked slyly, even triumphantly, at his
      smiling daughter and said: "Dolly thinks it will make good land for a
      peach-orchard. Lots of money is being made that way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bosh!" grunted Milburn. "It don't lie right fer peaches. You kin git jest
      as much property nigh the railroad as you want fer peaches. You are a hard
      man to trade with, but I reckon I 'll have to take yore offer of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold on, hold on!" laughed the Colonel, his hand upraised. "I didn't say
      I'd <i>take</i> that price. I just said I wouldn't listen to less than a
      dollar raise. I've listened to many a thing I didn't jump at, like a frog
      in muddy water, not knowing what he's going to butt against."
    </p>
    <p>
      Under his big shawl Milburn rose like a tent blown upward by wind. He was
      getting angry as he saw his commission money taking wing and flitting out
      of sight. He had evidently counted on making an easy victim of Barclay.
      For a moment he stood twisting his heavy, home-knit gloves in his horny
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now if it's a fair question," he said, as the last resort of a man ready
      and willing to trade at any reasonable cost, "what <i>will</i> you take,
      cash down, on your honor between us&mdash;me to accept or decline?"
    </p>

      The Colonel's pleasure was of the bubbling, overflowing kind. Every move
      made by Milburn was adding fuel to his hopes of the proposed railroad, and
      to his determination to be nobody's victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here," he said, "that land has been rising at such a rate since you
      came in that I'm actually afraid to let it go. By dinner-time it may make
      me rich. Dolly, I believe, on my word, Milburn has discovered gold over
      there. Haven't you, Milburn? Now, honor bright."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be a long time before you find gold or anything else on that
      land," Milburn retorted, as he reached for his hat and heavily strode from
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! I do declare," and Mrs. Barclay turned to Dolly and her father.
      "What on earth does this mean?" The Colonel laughed out, then slapped his
      hand over his mouth, as he peered from the window to see if Milburn was
      out of hearing. "It's just this way&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mind, father!" cautioned Dolly. "Do you want it to be all over town by
      dinner-time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dolly!" cried Mrs. Barclay, "the idea of such a thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly smiled and patted her mother on the cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't tell her, papa," she said, with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The truth is," said the Colonel, "Dolly really wants to plant peaches. I
      don't think there's much in it, but she will have her way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I call that <i>mean</i> of you," retorted Mrs. Barclay, dark with
      vexation. "Well, miss, I 'll bet you didn't tell your father who you went
      sleigh-riding with."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man frowned suddenly. "Not with Alan Bishop," he said, "after my
      positive orders?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He came to tell me about the&mdash;the"&mdash;Dolly glanced at her mother
      suddenly&mdash;"about the peaches, papa."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well"&mdash;the Colonel was waxing angry&mdash;"I won't have it&mdash;that's
      all. I won't have you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait, papa," entreated the girl, sweetly, "wait till we see about the&mdash;peaches!"
      And, with a little teasing laugh, she left the room.

      HE mass-meeting at Springtown was a most important event. It was held in
      the court-house in the centre of the few straggling houses which made up
      the hamlet. The entire Bishop family, including the servants, attended.
      Pole Baker brought his wife and all the children in a new spring-wagon.
      Darley society was represented, as the Springtown <i>Gazette</i>
      afterwards put it, by the fairest of the fair, Miss Dolly Barclay,
      accompanied by her mother and father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The court-house yard was alive with groups of men eagerly talking over the
      situation. Every individual whose land was to be touched by the proposed
      road was on hand to protect his rights. Pole Baker was ubiquitous, trying
      to ascertain the drift of matters. He was, however, rather unsuccessful.
      He discovered that many of the groups ceased to talk when he entered them.
      "Some 'n' s up," he told Alan and Miller in the big, bare-looking
      court-room. "I don't know what it is, but I smell a rat, an' it ain't no
      little one, nuther."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Opposition," said Miller, gloomily. "I saw that as soon as I came. If
      they really were in favor of the road they'd be here talking it over with
      us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid that's it," said Alan. "Joe Bartell is the most interested,
      and he seems to be a sort of ringleader. I don't like the way he looks. I
      saw him sneer at Wilson when he drove up just now. I wish Wilson hadn't
      put on so much style&mdash;kid gloves, plug hat, and a negro driver."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, that won't go down with this crowd," agreed Miller. "It might in the
      slums of Boston, but not with these lords of the mountains. As for
      Bartell, I think I know what ails him. He's going to run for the
      legislature and thinks he can make votes by opposing us&mdash;convincing
      his constituency that we represent moneyed oppression. Well, he may down
      us, but it's tough on human progress."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan caught Dolly's eye and bowed. She was seated near her father and
      mother, well towards the judge's stand. She seemed to have been observing
      the faces of the two friends, and to be affected by their serious
      expressions. Adele sat at the long wood stove, several yards from her
      parents, who appeared quite as if they were in church waiting for service
      to begin. Abner Daniel leaned in the doorway opening into one of the
      jury-rooms. Wilson had given him a fine cigar, which he seemed to be
      enjoying hugely.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the hour appointed for the meeting, to open, a young man who held the
      office of bailiff in the county, and seemed proud of his stentorian voice,
      opened one of the windows and shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in to court! Come in to court!" and the motley loiterers below began
      to clatter up the broad stairs and fall into the seats. Joe Bartell, a
      short, thick-set man in the neighborhood of fifty, with a florid face and
      a shock of reddish hair, led about twenty men up the aisle to the
      jury-benches at the right of the stand. They were the land-owners whose
      consent to grant the right of way was asked. Stern opposition was clearly
      written on the leader's brow and more or less distinctly reflected on the
      varying faces of his followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ef we needed it, it ud be a different matter," Miller overheard him say
      in a sudden lull, as the big room settled down into sudden quiet, "but we
      kin do without it. We've got along so fur an' we kin furder. All of us has
      got good teams."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson, in his crisp, brusque way, made the opening speech. He told his
      hearers just what his company proposed to do and in much the same
      cold-blooded way as he would have dictated a letter to his stenographer,
      correctly punctuating the text by pauses, and yet, in his own way,
      endeavoring to be eloquent. He and his capital were going to dispel
      darkness where it had reigned since the dawn of civilization; people
      living there now would not recognize the spot ten years from the day the
      first whistle of a locomotive shrilled through those rocky gorges and
      rebounded from those lofty peaks&mdash;silent fingers pointing to God and
      speaking of a past dead and gone. All that was needed, he finished, was
      the consent of the property-owners appealed to; who, he felt confident,
      would not stand in their own light. They looked like intelligent men, and
      he believed they did not deceive appearances.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly taken his seat when Joe Bartell stood up. Alan and Miller
      exchanged ominous glances. They had at once recognized the
      inappropriateness of Wilson's speech, and did not like the white,
      twitching sneer on Bartell's smooth-shaven face. It was as if Bartell had
      been for a long time seeking just such an opportunity to make himself felt
      in the community, and there was no doubt that Wilson's almost dictatorial
      speech had made a fine opening for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fellow-citizens, an' ladies an' gentlemen," he began, "we are glad to
      welcome amongst us a sort of a second savior in our Sodom an' Gomorry of
      cracker-dom. What the gentleman with the plug hat an' spike-toe shoes
      ain't a-goin' to do fer us the Lord couldn't. He looks nice an' talks
      nice, an', to use his words, I don't believe he deceives appearances. I
      'll bet one thing, an' that is 'at he won't deceive us. Accordin' to him
      we need 'im every hour, as the Sunday-school song puts it. Yes, he's
      a-goin' to he'p us powerful an' right off. An', fellow-citizens, I'm heer
      to propose a vote o' thanks. He's from away up in Boston, whar, they tell
      me, a nigger sets an' eats at the same table with the whites. When his
      sort come this away durin' the war, with all the'r up-to-date impliments
      of slaughter, they laid waste to ever'thing they struck, shot us like
      rabbits in holes, an' then went back an' said they'd had a good hunt. But
      they've been livin' high up thar sence the war an' the'r timber is
      a-playin' out, an' they want some more now, an' they <i>want it bad</i>.
      So they send the'r representatives out to find it an' lay hold of it. How
      does he happen to come heer? As well as I kin make out, old Alf Bishop, a
      good man an' a Southern soldier&mdash;a man that I hain't got nothin'
      agin, except maybe he holds his head too high, made up his mind awhile
      back that lumber would be in demand some day, an' he set to work buyin'
      all the timber-land he could lay his hands on. Then, when he had more'n he
      could tote, an' was about to go under, he give this gentleman a' option on
      it. Well, so fur so good; but, gentlemen, what have <i>we</i> got to do
      with this trade? Nothin' as I kin see. But we are expected to yell an'
      holler, an' deed 'em a free right of way through our property so they kin
      ship the timber straight through to the North an' turn it into cold Yankee
      coin. We don't count in this shuffle, gentlemen. We git our pay fer our
      land in bein' glad an' heerin' car-bells an' steam-whistles in the middle
      o' the night when we want to sleep. The engynes will kill our hogs,
      cattle, an' hosses, an' now an' then break the neck o' some chap that
      wasn't hit in the war, but we mustn't forget to be glad an' bend the knee
      o' gratitude. Of course, we all know the law kin compel us to give the
      right of way, but it provides fer just and sufficient payment fer the
      property used; an', gentlemen, I'm agin donations. I'm agin' em tooth an'
      toe-nail."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was thunderous and ominous applause when Bartell sat down. Wilson
      sat flushed and embarrassed, twirling his gloves in his hands. He had
      expected anything but this personal fusillade. He stared at Miller in
      surprise over that gentleman's easy, half-amused smile as he stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen," he began, "and ladies," he added, with a bow to the right and
      left. "As many of you know, I pretend to practise law a little, and I want
      to say now that I'm glad Mr. Bartell ain't in the profession. A lawyer
      with his keen wit and eloquence could convict an innocent mother before a
      jury of her own children. [Laughter.] And that's the point, gentlemen; we
      are innocent of the charges against us. I am speaking now of my clients,
      the Bishops. They are deeply interested in the development of this
      section. The elder Bishop does hold his head high, and in this case he
      held it high enough to smell coming prosperity in the air. He believed it
      would come, and that is why he bought timber-lands extensively. As for the
      accused gentleman from the Hub of the Universe, I must say that I have
      known of him for several years and have never heard a word against his
      character. He is not a farmer, but a business man, and it would be unfair
      to judge him by any other standard. He is not only a business man, but a
      big one. He handles big things. This railroad is going to be a big thing
      for you and your children. Yes, Wilson is all right. He didn't fight in
      the late unpleasantness. He tells the women he was too young; but I
      believe he hadn't the heart to fight a cause as just as ours. His only
      offence is in the matter of wearing sharp-toed shoes. There is no law
      against 'em in Atlanta, and he's simply gotten careless. He is ignorant of
      our ideas of proper dress, as befitting a meek and lowly spirit, which, in
      spite of appearances, I happen to know Wilson possesses. However, I have
      heard him say that these mountains produce the best corn liquor that ever
      went down grade in his system. He's right. It's good. Pole Baker says it's
      good, and he ought to know. [Laughter, in which Pole joined
      good-naturedly.] That reminds me of a story," Miller went on. "They tell
      this of Baker. They say that a lot of fellows were talking of the
      different ways they would prefer to meet death if it had to come. One said
      drowning, another shooting, another poisoning, and so on; but Pole
      reserved his opinion to the last. When the crowd urged him to say what
      manner of death he would select, if he had to die and had his choice, he
      said: 'Well, boys, ef I had to go, I'd like to be melted up into puore
      corn whiskey an' poured through my throat tell thar wasn't a drap left of
      me.'[Laughter and prolonged applause.] And Wilson said further, gentlemen
      and ladies, that he believed the men and women of this secluded section
      were, in their own way, living nearer to God than the inhabitants of the
      crowded cities. Wilson is not bad, even if he has a hang-dog look. A
      speech like Bartell's just now would give a hang-dog look to a
      paling-fence. Wilson is here to build a railroad for your good and
      prosperity, and he can' t build one where there is nothing to haul out. If
      he buys up timber for his company, it is the only way to get them to back
      him in the enterprise. Now, gentlemen of the opposition, if there are any
      here to-day, don't let the thought of Wilson's possible profit rob you of
      this golden opportunity. I live at Darley, but, as many of you know, this
      is my father's native county, and I want to see it bloom in progress and
      blossom like the rose of prosperity. I want to see the vast mineral wealth
      buried in these mountains dug out for the benefit of mankind wherever
      God's sunlight falls."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller sat down amid much applause, a faint part of which came even from
      the ranks of Bartell's faction. After this a pause ensued in which no one
      seemed willing to speak. Colonel Barclay rose and came to Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was a good talk," he whispered. "You understand how to touch 'em up.
      You set them to laughin'; that's the thing. I wonder if it would do any
      good for me to try my hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do they know you have any timber-land over here?" asked Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, I guess they do," replied the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I don't believe I'd chip in," advised Miller. "Bartell would throw
      it up to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon you are right," said Barclay, "but for the Lord's sake do
      something. It never will do to let this thing fall through."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've done all I can," said Miller, dejectedly. "Bartell's got the whole
      gang hoodooed&mdash;the blasted blockhead! Wouldn't he make a fine
      representative in the legislature?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel went back to his seat, and Wilson came to Miller, just as Alan
      approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's going to fall flatter than a pancake," said Wilson. "My company
      simply cannot afford to buy the right of way. Can' t you choke that
      illiterate fellow over there or&mdash;or buy him off?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He ain't that sort," said Miller, disconsolately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan glanced at his father and mother. On their wrinkled faces lay ample
      evidences of dejection. The old man seemed scarcely to breathe. Up to
      Bartell's speech he had seemed buoyantly hopeful, but his horizon had
      changed; he looked as if he were wondering why he had treated himself to
      such a bright view of a thing which had no foundation at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Abner Daniel rose from his seat near the stove and slowly
      walked forward till he stood facing the audience. Immediately quiet
      reigned, for he was a man who was invariably listened to.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen an' ladies," he began, clearing his throat and wiping his mouth
      with his long hand. "This ain't no put-in o' mine, gracious knows! I
      hain't got nothin', an' I don't expect to lose or gain by what is done in
      this matter, but I want to do what I kin fer what I think is right an'
      proper. Fer my part, I don't think we kin do without a railroad much
      longer. Folks is a-pokin' fun at us, I tell you. It's God's truth. T'other
      day I was over at Darley a-walkin' along the railroad nigh the
      turnin'-table, whar they flirt engynes round like children on a
      flyin'-jinny, when all at once a big strappin' feller with a red flag in
      his hand run up an' knocked me off'n the track kerwhallop in a ditch. It
      was just in time to keep me from bein' run over by a switch-engyne. He was
      as mad as Tucker. 'Looky' heer,' ses he, 'did you think that thing was
      playin' tag with you an' ud tap you on the shoulder an' run an' hide
      behind a tree? Say, ain't you from Short Pine Destrict, this side o' the
      mountains?' I told 'im he'd guessed right, an' he said, 'I'lowed so, fer
      thar ain't no other spot on the whirlin' globe that produces folks as
      green as gourds.' Well, gentlemen, that floored me; it was bad enough to
      be jerked about like a rag doll, but it was tough to heer my section
      jeered at. 'What makes you say that?' I axed 'im, as I stood thar tryin'
      to git a passle o' wet glass out o' my hip-pocket without cuttin' my
      fingers. [Laughter, led by Pole Baker, who sensed the meaning of the
      reference.] 'Beca'se,' ses he, 'you moss-backs over thar don't know the
      war's over; a nigger from over thar come in town t'other day an' heerd fer
      the fust time that he was free. Two men over thar swapped wives without
      knowin' thar was a law agin it. Half o' you-uns never laid eyes on a
      railroad, an' wouldn't have one as a free gift.' I turned off an' left 'im
      an' went up on the main street. Up thar a barber ketched me by the arm an'
      said, ses he: 'Come in an' le' me cut that hair. You are from Short Pine,
      ain't you?' I axed him why he thought so, an' he said, ses he, 'beca'se
      you got a Short Pine hair-cut.'' What's that?'ses I. An' he laughed at a
      feller cocked up in a cheer an' said: 'It's a cut that is made by the
      women out yore way. They jest turn a saucer upside down on the men's heads
      an' trim around the edges. I could tell one a mile; they make a man look
      like a bob-tailed mule.'[Laughter, loud and prolonged.] Yes, as I said,
      they are a-pokin' all manner o' fun at us, an' it's chiefly beca'se we
      hain't got no railroad. The maddest I ever got on this line was down at
      Filmore's store one day. A little, slick chap come along sellin' maps of
      the United States of America. They was purty things on black sticks, an' I
      wanted one fer the wall o' my room. I was about to buy one, but I thought
      I'd fust make shore that our county was on it, so I axed the peddler to
      p'int it out to me. Well, after some s'arch, he put his knife-blade on
      what he called this county, but lo an' behold! it was mighty nigh kivered
      with round dots about the size of fly-specks. 'What's the matter with
      it?'I axed 'im. 'Oh, you mean them dots,' ses he, an' he turned to a lot
      o' reference words in the corner of the map. 'Them,' ses he, 'them's put
      thar to indicate the amount o' ignorance in a locality. You 'll find 'em
      in all places away from the railroads; a body kin say what they please
      agin railroads, but they fetch schools, an' books, an' enlightenment.
      You've got a good many specks' ses he, kinder comfortin' like, 'but some
      o' these days a railroad will shoot out this away, an' them brainy men
      amongst you will git the chance God intends to give 'em,' Gentlemen, I
      didn't buy no map. I wouldn't 'a' had the thing on my wall with them
      specks a-starin' me in the face. It wouldn't 'a' done any good to scrape
      'em off, fer the'r traces would 'a' been left. No, friends, citizens, an'
      well-wishers, thar ain't but one scraper that will ever rake our specks
      off, an' that's the cow-catcher of a steam-engyne. I say let 'er come.
      Some objection has been raised on the score o' killin' cattle. That
      reminds me of a story they tell on old Burt Preston, who has a farm on the
      main line beyant Darley. He was always a-gittin' his stock killed so fast,
      an' a-puttin' in heavy claims fer damages, until folks begun to say he
      made his livin' by buyin' scrub cattle an' sellin' mashed beef to the
      corporation. One day the road sent out a detective to watch 'im, an' he
      seed Burt drive a spindlin' yeerlin' out o' the thicket on the track jest
      in time to get it knocked off by a through freight. The detective went
      back an' reported, an' they waited to see what Preston ud do. By the next
      mail they got a claim in which Preston said the yeerlin' weighed eight
      hundred pound an' was a fine four-gallon milch-cow. They threatened to
      jail 'im, an' Preston agreed to withdraw his claim. But he got
      down-hearted an' traded his place fer a farm on t'other railroad, an' the
      last I heerd o' him he was at his old trade agin. I reckon that's about
      the way we 'll be damaged by gettin' our stock killed. That's all I got to
      say, gentlemen. Let's git this road an' scrape our fly-specks off."
    </p>
    <p>
      The big house shook with the applause that greeted this speech. Even the
      opposition seemed to be wavering. Only Bartell kept a rigid countenance.
      He rose and in a low voice invited his group to repair with him to one of
      the jury-rooms. They got up and followed him out. As he was about to close
      the door after them he nodded to Miller. "We 'll take a vote on it an' let
      you know," he said, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's going to talk to them," said Miller, aloud to Wilson. "Mr. Daniel's
      speech almost shook them out of their boots, and he saw he was losing
      ground. It looks squally."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right," said Wilson, gloomily. "Our chances are very slim."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller caught Adele's eye and went to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm bound to say the outlook is not so favorable," he said. "If we could
      have put it to a vote just after your uncle spoke we would have clinched
      them, but Bartell thinks his election depends on beating us today, and
      being the chief land-owner he has influence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will break my heart," said the girl, tremulously. "Poor father and
      mother! They look as if they were on trial for their lives. Oh, I had so
      much hope as we drove over here this morning, but now&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can' t bear to see you take it that way," said Miller, tenderly. "I did
      not intend to speak to you so soon about another matter, but I can' t put
      it off. You have become very, very dear to me, little girl. In fact, I
      never dreamed there was such a thing as genuine, unselfish love till I
      knew you. It seems to me that you were actually created for me. I want you
      to be my wife. Somehow I feel that you care for me, at least a little, and
      I believe when you realize how much I love you, and how devoted I shall
      be, you will love me as I do you."
    </p>
    <p>
      To his surprise she averted her face and said nothing, though he remarked
      that she had paled a little and compressed her lips. He waited a moment,
      then said, anxiously:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't you something to say, Adele? Perhaps I have misread you all along
      and really have no right to hope. Oh, that would be hard to bear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not that," she said, her breast heaving suddenly. "It is not that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that?" he repeated, his wondering eyes fixed on hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alan has told me of some of your talks to him about love, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he has!" Miller laughed out uneasily. "But surely you wouldn't hold
      anything against me that I said before I met you in Atlanta and fell heels
      over head in love with you. Besides, I was simply stretching my
      imagination to save him from making a serious mistake. But I know what it
      is to care for a girl now, and I have wanted to tell him so, but simply
      could not face him with my confession&mdash;when&mdash;when his own sister
      was in question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have tried to believe," Adele hesitated, "that you had changed in your
      ideas of love since&mdash;since we learned to know each other, and I
      confess I succeeded to some extent, but there was one thing that simply
      sticks and refuses to be eradicated. It sticks more right now than ever. I
      mean this morning, since&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you <i>do</i> surprise me," declared Miller. "Please explain. Don't
      you see I'm simply dying with impatience?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You pressed the point in one of those talks with brother," said Adele,
      quite firmly, "that it was impossible for two people of unequal fortune to
      be happy together, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you wouldn't surely hurl that rubbish at me," broke in Miller. "I
      never would have dreamed of saying such a thing if I had not thought Alan
      was about to butt his head against a stone wall in the hostility of
      Colonel Barclay. If he had been fairly well off and she had been without
      money I'd have said sail in and take her, but I knew what a mercenary old
      man Barclay is, and I thought I could save the boy from a good many
      heartaches."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That&mdash;even as you now put it&mdash;would be hard for a girl in my
      position to forget," Adele told him. "For if this enterprise fails to-day,
      I shall&mdash;just think of it!&mdash;I shall not only be penniless, but
      my father will owe you a large amount of money that he never will be able
      to pay. Oh, I could not bear to go to you under such circumstances! I have
      always wanted my independence, and this grates on my very soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met in a long, steady stare. "Oh, you must&mdash;you really
      must not see it that way," floundered the young man. "You will make me
      very miserable. I can' t live without you, Adele. Besides, I shall not
      lose by the loan I made to your father. The land will bring the money back
      sooner or later, and what will it matter? You will be my wife and your
      parents will be my parents. Already I love them as my own. Oh, darling,
      don't turn me down this way! Really I can' t help the turn matters have
      taken, and if you care for me you ought not to wreck our happiness for a
      silly whim like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat unmoved for a moment, avoiding the fervid glow of his
      passion-filled eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If this thing fails I shall be very unhappy," she finally said. "Its
      success would not make me rich, but it would remove a debt that has nearly
      killed me. I have never mentioned it, but it has been like a sword hanging
      over my happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it shall not fail," he told her. "It shall not fail! If those
      blockheads vote against it, I 'll buy the right of way, if it takes the
      last cent I've got."
    </p>
    <p>
      This forced a smile to Adele's lips. "Then we'd be as deep in the mud as
      we now are in the mire," she said. Just then Pole Baker came to Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to make no break," he said, "but I've got a idea I'd like to
      work on them hill-Billies in the jury-room if you hain't no objections. I
      hain't got time to tell you about it, but as you are a-runnin' the shebang
      I thought I'd ax permission."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go and do what you think best, Pole," said Miller, recklessly. "We can
      trust to your head, and anything is better than nothing just now. I really
      think it's gone by the board."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, thanky'," said Pole, as he shuffled away. He marched straight
      to the jury-room, and, without rapping, opened the door and went in,
      closing the door after him. He found the men all discussing the matter and
      was delighted to find that the strength of the opposition now rested
      chiefly in Bartell and a few men who seemed afraid to pull away from him.
      Pole slid up to Bartell and said, as he drew him to one side: "Say, Mr.
      Bartell, what on earth have you got agin Alan Bishop?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, nothin', Pole, as I know of," said Bartell, rather sheepishly.
      "Nothin' as I know of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it looks to me like you got a mighty pore way o' showin' good-will.
      Why, he's the best friend you got, Mr. Bartell, an' totes more votes in
      his vest-pocket fer you than any man in this county."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh! You don't say!" grunted Bartell, in slow surprise. "Well, he never
      told <i>me</i> about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beca'se you hain't announced yorese'f yet," said Pole, with a steady eye
      and a set face. "Why, he said t'other day to several of us at the
      log-rollin'&mdash;you remember you rid by on yore bay, leadin' a milch-cow
      by a rope. Well, after you passed Alan Bishop said: 'Boys, thar goes the
      only man in this county that has convictions an' the courage to stand by
      'em. They say he's goin' to run fer the legislature an' ef he does, I 'll
      do all I kin to elect 'im. He 'll make the best representative that we
      ever had. He's got brains, <i>he</i> has.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't say!" Bartell's face beamed, his eye kindled and flashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's jest what!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hadn't the least idea he was fer me," said Bartell, drawing a deep
      breath. "In fact, I 'lowed he would be agin anybody but a town man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alan never talks much," said Pole, in a tone of conviction; "he <i>acts</i>
      when the time comes fer it. But, la me, Mr. Bartell, this is agoin' to
      break him all to pieces. He's in love with old Barclay's gal, an' she is
      with him. Ef he puts this road through to-day he 'll git his daddy out o'
      debt an' Barclay will withdraw his opposition. I don't know how you feel,
      but I'd hate like smoke to bu'st a man all to flinders that thought as
      much o' me as Alan does o' you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never knowed he was fer me," was Bartell's next tottering step in the
      right direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, vote fer the right o' way, an' you kin ride to an' from Atlanta
      durin' session all rail. Me'n Alan will pull fer you like a yoke o' steers&mdash;me
      with the moonshiners, an' my mountain clan, that ain't dead yet, an' him
      with his gang. What you say? Put up or shet up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'll do what I kin," said Bartell, a new light on his face, as he turned
      to the others. "Gentlemen," he began, "listen to me a minute. I see a good
      many of you was affected by Ab Daniel's speech an' sort o' want the road,
      anyway, so if&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't exactly like them specks," broke in a fat, middle-aged man at a
      window. "By gum! I believe old Ab had us down about right. Ef we kin git
      sort o' opened up along with the rest o' creation, I say le's git in the
      game. Huh!"&mdash;the man finished, with a laughing shrug&mdash;"I don't
      like them fly-specks one bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me nuther," said a man beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nur me!" came from some one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm willin' ef the rest are," announced Bar-tell. "All in favor
      hold up yore hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole Baker grinned broadly as he counted them. "All up&mdash;the last
      one," he said, then he sprang for the door and stood before the expectant
      audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Toot! toot!" he cried, imitating the whistle of a locomotive. "All
      aboard! The road's a settled thing. They say they don't want no specks,
      an' they ain't agoin' to have 'em. Hooray!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The audience was electrified by the announcement. For an instant there was
      a pause of incredulous astonishment, and then the floor resounded from the
      clatter of feet and glad shouts filled the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan, his face ablaze with startled triumph, came towards Adele and
      Miller. "Pole worked the rabbit-foot on them back there," he said. "I
      don't know what he did, but he did something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He told me he had a card left," laughed Miller. "I 'll bet he had it up
      his sleeve. There he is now. Oh, Pole, come here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man thus addressed slouched down the aisle to them, his big, brown
      eyes flashing merrily under his heavy brows, his sun-browned face dark
      with the flush of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out with it, you rascal," said Alan. "What did you say to them? Whatever
      it was it knocked their props clean from under them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ef you don't back me in it, I'm a gone dog," said Pole to Alan. "All I
      want you to do is to vote for Bartell, ef you kin possibly swallow the
      dose."
    </p>
    <p>
      A light broke on the two men. "I 'll do it if you say so, Pole," said
      Alan. "Not only that, but I 'll work for him if you wish it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole looked down and pulled at his heavy mustache. "Well," he smiled, "I
      reckon he won't harm us any more in the legislatur' than the road 'll do
      us good, so you'd better support 'im. I seed the bars down a minute ago,
      an' I didn't have no time to consult you. I'd 'a' told a bigger lie 'an
      that to clinch this thing." Abner Daniel joined them, smiling broadly, his
      eyes twinkling joyously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've won, Uncle Ab," exclaimed Alan; "what do you think of that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The old jester stroked his face and swung his long body back and forth in
      the wind of his content. "I've always argued," said he, "that what is to
      be <i>will</i> be, an' it <i>will</i> be a sight sooner 'n most of us
      count on, ef we 'll jest keep our sperits up."
    </p>
    <p>
      The others moved on, leaving Adele and Miller together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, just look at mamma and papa," she said, in the round, full voice
      indicative of deep emotion. "They are so glad they are about to cry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a dear, dear girl you are," said Miller, softly. "There is nothing
      to separate us now, is there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment they met in a full look into each other's eyes. Adele's voice
      shook when she replied: "I believe I'm the happiest, proudest girl in all
      the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you love me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe I've loved you from the very minute I met you in Atlanta last
      summer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan saw Dolly looking at him and waving her handkerchief, her face warm
      and flushed. He was tempted to go to her, but she still sat by her father
      and mother, and that fact checked him. Mrs. Barclay caught his eye, and,
      rising suddenly, came through the crowd to him. She extended her gloved
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You and Dolly must stop your foolishness," she said. "I've been thinking
      of a plan to help you two out. If I were you I wouldn't say a word to her
      now, but next Sunday night come and take her to church just like you used
      to. I 'll attend to Colonel Barclay. He is just tickled to death over this
      thing and he won't make any fuss. He is as stubborn as a mule, though, and
      when he has to give in, it's better not to let him think you are gloating
      over him. He won't bother you any more; I 'll see to that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan thanked her. He was so full of happiness that he was afraid to trust
      his voice to utterance. As Mrs. Barclay was going back to her husband and
      daughter, Pole Baker passed. Alan grasped him by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, Pole," he said, his voice full and quavering, "I want to tell you
      that I think more of you than I do of any man alive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Alan," said Pole, awkwardly, yet with an eye that did not waver, "I
      kin shore return the compliment. Ef it hadn't been fer you an' yore advice
      I'd 'a' been in hell long ago, an' as it is, I feel more like livin' a
      straight, honest life than I ever did. You never axed me but one thing
      that I didn't grant, an' that was to give up whiskey. I don't know whether
      I ever will be able to do it or not, but, by the great God above, I'm
      agoin' to keep on tryin', fer I know you want it jest fer my good. I don't
      want a dram to-day, fer a wonder, an' maybe in time I 'll git over my
      thirst."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Alan was about to get into his buggy with his uncle, the Colonel and
      his wife and daughter passed. With a sheepish look on his face the old man
      bowed to the two men, but Dolly stopped before Alan and held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were going away without even speaking to me," she said, a catch in
      her voice. "Think of it&mdash;to-day of all days to be treated like that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But your mother told me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't I tell you she couldn't be relied on?" broke in Dolly, with a
      smile. "I have more influence with papa than she has. I know what she told
      you. I made her confess it just now. Are you going to town to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he informed her; "we shall complete the arrangements there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then come right down to see me as soon as you possibly can," Dolly said.
      "I'm dying to see you&mdash;to talk with you. Oh, Alan, I'm so&mdash;<i>so</i>
      happy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So am I," he told her, as he pressed her hand tenderly. "Then I shall see
      you again to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, to-day, sure," she said, and she moved on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's all right," said Abner Daniel, as Alan climbed in the buggy beside
      him. "She's all wool an' a yard wide."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon you are satisfied with the way it come out, Uncle Ab," said his
      nephew, flushing over the compliment to Dolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jest want one thing more," said the old man, "an' I can't make out
      whether it's a sin or not. I want to face Perkins an' Abe Tompkins. I'd
      give my right arm to meet 'em an' watch the'r faces when they heer about
      the railroad, an' the price yore pa's land fetched."

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
